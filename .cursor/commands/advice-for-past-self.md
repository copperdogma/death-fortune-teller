# Advice for Past Self

I'm going to reset this chat which will destroy all context and revert all code.

I want you to write advice to your past self with everything critical that you've learned so you can try again.

Write out very succinctly:

- Start with a succinct description of what feature you were attempting to build or test you were attempting to run that failed.
- What you attempted to do to fix the issue and why it failed. Should we continue down that path? Why or why not?
- Any critical wisdom you gained about the system that would be useful context for solving this issue.
- Any promising ideas of what to try next to solve this issue.

IMPORTANT: If you feel there you added critical net good code that should be kept, explain what code should be kept and why. If so, be clear about what code should be kept and what should be reverted.

## ESP32-Specific Context

When writing advice, consider:

- **Hardware Issues**: Power supply problems, wiring issues, component failures
- **Firmware Problems**: Memory leaks, timing issues, interrupt conflicts
- **PlatformIO Issues**: Build configuration, library conflicts, upload problems
- **Serial Communication**: UART timing, baud rate mismatches, buffer overflows
- **SD Card Issues**: File system corruption, audio file format problems
- **Servo Control**: PWM timing, power requirements, mechanical issues
- **Thermal Printer**: Paper feed, print quality, communication protocols
