# Validate Work Against Requirements

Thoroughly analyze what was done and how it compares to the original instructions using git diff and file analysis.

## Analysis Process

1. **Review Changes**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only
   git diff --stat
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. **Examine Modified Files**
   - Open each changed file to understand what was implemented
   - Compare against original requirements/story/documentation
   - Check for completeness, quality, and adherence to specifications

3. **Score Each Requirement**
   - **A**: Fully implemented, high quality, exceeds expectations
   - **B**: Implemented well, minor improvements possible
   - **C**: Implemented but has notable issues or missing elements
   - **D**: Partially implemented or significant problems
   - **F**: Not implemented or completely incorrect
