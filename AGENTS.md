# AI Agent Guidelines

## This Project is AI-First
I may do some hand-coding now and then, but 99% of the code will be written by AI. Do not expect the user to do anything in the code themselves.

## Do Not Check In Without an Explicit Request To Do So

## Story-Driven Development
/docs/stories/stories.md is the master list of stories. When done a story and it's verified by a human, mark it as complete.

Each story has an explicit story document, e.g.: docs/stories/story-003b-built-in-sd-card-migration.md

The story document is to be used constantly as a work log for the story, including everything you try, the result, and the next steps. See the build-story.md command for more details.
