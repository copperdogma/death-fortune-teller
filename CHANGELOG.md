20251021: Project Created.

20251022: Codex got the base code working in platformio! It was based off TwoSkulls, but that was build in Arduino IDE and I wasnt sure if that was REQUIRED to get the code working, especailly the esp32-a2dp library and audio streaming. But Codex got it working under platformio.
