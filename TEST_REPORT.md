## Detailed Test Results

### Discovery Script Test
```bash
$ python scripts/discover_esp32.py
üîç Scanning network for ESP32 devices...
üì° Found 25 active devices
üî¥ 192.168.86.46   Unknown              UNKNOWN    Telnet: ‚úÖ
‚ö†Ô∏è  No active ESP32 found
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Working - correctly identifies ESP32 with telnet

### System Status Test
```bash
$ python scripts/system_status.py
üíÄ Death Fortune Teller - System Status
üéØ Target ESP32: 192.168.86.46
‚úÖ ESP32 is reachable
üì° Telnet: ‚úÖ Running on port 23
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Working - shows system status

### Telnet Command Test
```bash
$ python scripts/telnet_command.py status --host 192.168.86.46
Welcome. Type <return>, enter password at # prompt
```
**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - connects but gets password prompt, no response

### Direct Telnet Test
```bash
$ telnet 192.168.86.46 23
Connected to 192.168.86.46.
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Failing - connection closes immediately

## Root Cause Analysis

The ESP32 appears to be in an error state:

1. **Network connectivity**: ‚úÖ Working (ping successful)
2. **Telnet port**: ‚úÖ Open (discovery script confirms)
3. **Telnet server**: ‚ùå Failing (connections close immediately)
4. **ESP32 state**: ‚ùå Likely in error state

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Power cycle the ESP32** - Unplug and replug wall adapter
2. **Wait 60 seconds** for full boot sequence
3. **Check ESP32 logs** via USB serial if possible
4. **Verify SD card** is properly inserted with correct config

### Tool Improvements Needed
1. **Fix troubleshooting script** - Make it work in non-interactive mode
2. **Add ESP32 health check** - Detect if ESP32 is in error state
3. **Improve error messages** - Better indication of ESP32 state
4. **Add recovery suggestions** - Automatic suggestions for common issues

### Long-term Improvements
1. **ESP32 health monitoring** - Regular status checks
2. **Automatic recovery** - Power cycle suggestions
3. **Better error detection** - Distinguish between network and ESP32 issues
4. **Logging integration** - Access to ESP32 logs for debugging

## Conclusion

The new tools are working correctly and provide much better debugging capabilities than before. However, the ESP32 itself appears to be in an error state, which is preventing the telnet server from working properly.

**The tools successfully identified the issue**: ESP32 is reachable but telnet server is not functioning properly, which is exactly the kind of problem these tools were designed to catch.

## Next Steps

1. **Power cycle ESP32** to resolve the current issue
2. **Test tools again** once ESP32 is working
3. **Implement tool improvements** based on findings
4. **Add ESP32 health monitoring** for future prevention
