# OTA Issues Debugging Log

> ‚úÖ **Operational reminder:** Before every OTA attempt, run `python scripts/discover_esp32.py` (or `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto`) to capture the skull‚Äôs current IP. Set `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` or pass `--upload-port <ip>` to PlatformIO using that value‚ÄîDHCP routinely flips between 192.168.86.46 and 192.168.86.49. Double-check the latest boot log (look for `WiFiManager: IP address` and `RSSI`) if in doubt.

### Step 9: 2025-10-24 21:53 MDT ‚Äì Current OTA Investigation
**Action**: Took over debugging with hardware on USB, verified SD `config.txt` (role=primary, ota_password=***REDACTED***) and established plan.
**Result**: **IN PROGRESS** ‚Äì Preparing to disable telnet streaming during OTA and capture logs post-failure.
**Notes**:
- OTA partition slots remain 0x1E0000 bytes; current firmware size is ~1.66‚ÄØMB (build succeeds).
- Failures observed at ~64‚ÄØ% likely `OTA_RECEIVE_ERROR` (transport drop), not partition overflow.
- Implemented firmware change to auto-pause RemoteDebug streaming during OTA (reduces competing TCP traffic); flashed via USB (`pio run -e esp32dev -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-10` on 2025-10-24 22:20 MDT).
- Serial capture post-flash confirms Wi-Fi connection and new IP 192.168.86.49 (updates needed for OTA host config).
- Added Wi-Fi stability tweaks (`WiFi.setSleep(false)`, `WiFi.setTxPower(WIFI_POWER_19_5dBm)`) and increased ArduinoOTA timeout to 45‚ÄØs; reflashed via USB (2025-10-24 22:45 MDT).
- Next actions:
  1. Run OTA with telnet `stream off`, immediately capture telnet log to confirm error code.
  2. Retry with `remoteDebugManager->update()` temporarily disabled if failure persists.
  3. Adjust OTA chunk rate/conditions if still failing.

**Latest test (2025-10-24 22:30 MDT)**: Invoked `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` while capturing USB serial. OTA session accepted auth but aborted almost immediately with `OTAManager: ‚ùå Error 3 (Receive failed)` and the guidance message (‚Äúüì∂ Receive failure‚Ä¶‚Äù). Board stayed on Wi-Fi (IP 192.168.86.49) and AutoStreaming resumed after abort; Bluetooth retries restarted automatically. Telnet connections from this machine still time out (likely network reachability issue), so log capture relied on direct serial.

### Step 10: 2025-10-24 22:45 MDT ‚Äì Reboot Loop Regression
**Action**: Observed repeated panics (`Error! Should enable WiFi modem sleep when both WiFi and Bluetooth are enabled!!!!!!`) after introducing Wi-Fi power tweaks.
**Result**: **FIXED** ‚Äì Moved `WiFi.setTxPower()` to post-connect handler and removed the `setSleep(false)` call; reflashed via USB (`pio run -e esp32dev -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-10`). Device now boots cleanly and reaches OTA-ready state again (IP 192.168.86.49).
**Notes**:
- Root cause: disabling Wi-Fi modem sleep conflicts with Bluetooth coexistence stack, triggering an ESP-IDF assert.
- Wi-Fi TX power still boosted after connection; crash no longer occurs.

### Step 11: 2025-10-24 22:55 MDT ‚Äì Resume OTA Failure Diagnosis
**Action**: With the board stable again, ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` (target IP 192.168.86.49) while capturing USB serial.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Host authenticated but then stalled at `Waiting for device‚Ä¶` before timing out. Device logged `Error 2 (Connection failed)` followed by `Error 4 (End failed)` at ~7‚ÄØs, then resumed normal operation (Wi-Fi stayed connected, Bluetooth retries restarted).
**Notes**:
- OTA progress never exceeded 0%; failure occurs immediately after the board pauses peripherals.
- Suggests the ESP32 tried to open the OTA data socket but either the connection dropped or was rejected by the host (likely network path issue from this machine to 192.168.86.49).
- Serial remains the reliable capture channel; telnet from this host still times out.

### Step 12: 2025-10-24 23:05 MDT ‚Äì IP Drift Detected
**Action**: Ran `python scripts/discover_esp32.py` to locate the active OTA target before the next upload attempt.
**Result**: **SUCCESS / IN FLUX** ‚Äì Discovery reported the skull at `192.168.86.46`, but the subsequent OTA attempt (with serial capture) showed the device reconnecting at `192.168.86.49`. Updated `platformio.ini` `upload_port` to match the latest serial log IP; concluded the ESP32‚Äôs DHCP lease is bouncing between addresses.
**Next Steps**:
- Use the auto-discovery workflow (`python scripts/ota_upload_auto.py`) immediately before each OTA, or export `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` based on the IP announced in the serial logs (`WiFiManager: IP address`).
- Retry OTA now that `upload_port` is aligned with the most recent IP; capture serial output to confirm whether `Error 2/4` clears.

### Step 13: 2025-10-24 23:12 MDT ‚Äì OTA Attempt on Fresh IP
**Action**: Re-ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload --upload-port 192.168.86.49` while logging USB serial to capture progress and errors.
**Result**: **FAILED at 39%** ‚Äì Host reported `Error Uploading` after ~33‚ÄØs. Serial trace shows OTA progress reaching 35‚Äì38‚ÄØ%, then no further messages (no explicit `Error` callback triggered, peripherals eventually resume). Indicates the TCP transfer still drops mid-stream even with the correct IP.
**Notes**:
- Failure occurs later (‚âà39‚ÄØ%) compared to earlier ~6‚ÄØ%, suggesting unstable Wi-Fi throughput rather than immediate connectivity rejection.
- Bluetooth connection attempts during OTA generate extra callbacks even though retries are paused; consider suppressing the logging chatter to reduce Wi-Fi contention.
- Next diagnostic: inspect Wi-Fi signal quality, ensure the skull is close to the AP, and possibly throttle the OTA chunk size or enforce modem sleep defaults to improve coexistence.

### Step 14: 2025-10-24 23:20 MDT ‚Äì Instrument Wi-Fi Metrics
**Action**: Added RSSI logging in `WiFiManager::handleConnection()` so the boot log records signal strength once the station connects; reflashed via USB to deploy.
**Status**: **COMPLETED** ‚Äì On next boot the serial log will report `WiFiManager: RSSI: <value>dBm`, making it easier to correlate OTA failures with poor signal. Also added `--host_ip=192.168.86.28` and `--timeout=45` to `platformio.local.ini` so espota uses this Mac‚Äôs LAN IP and a longer invitation window.

### Step 15: 2025-10-24 23:28 MDT ‚Äì Post-Flash Regression
**Action**: Captured 20‚ÄØs of serial output after the RSSI instrumentation flash to verify the new log line and resume OTA testing.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Board hit an ESP-IDF assertion `hash_map_set` shortly after Wi-Fi connected (while Bluetooth retries were active) and rebooted. The crash occurs before the `WiFiManager: RSSI` line appears, so instrumentation not yet confirmed.
**Notes**:
- Backtrace starts in `esp32-hal-bt`/Bluetooth stack; may be triggered by repeated A2DP retry logs or BT/Wi-Fi coexistence toggling.
- After reboot the device reconnects (IP again 192.168.86.49). Need to stabilize runtime before resuming OTA attempts.

### Step 16: 2025-10-24 23:35 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth Disabled, OTA Success
**Action**: Introduced `DISABLE_BLUETOOTH` build flag (now enabled for both `esp32dev` and `esp32dev_ota`) so the firmware skips A2DP initialization during OTA work. Reflashed via USB, confirmed the skull stays up (no Bluetooth logs, free heap ~115‚ÄØKB), then re-ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload --upload-port 192.168.86.49` with serial capture.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA upload completed in ~60‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`), with serial progress updates every 5‚ÄØ%. Device rebooted into the new image, reporting the new RSSI once connected (`WiFiManager: RSSI: -77dBm`).
**Notes**:
- Temporary trade-off: Bluetooth audio is disabled while we focus on OTA stability; remove `DISABLE_BLUETOOTH` once uploads are reliable again.
- With OTA flowing, next steps are to re-enable Bluetooth incrementally (or gate it behind a config flag) and confirm uploads remain stable.

### Step 17: 2025-10-24 23:42 MDT ‚Äì Runtime Bluetooth Toggle
**Action**: Added `bluetooth_enabled` support in config plus pause/resume hooks so Bluetooth can auto-pause during OTA. Rebuilt without the compile flag, leaving `bluetooth_enabled=true`, and attempted OTA.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì OTA still crashes the Bluetooth stack almost immediately (`hash_map_set` assert, later Guru Meditation in `btc_a2dp_cb_handler`) even though retries are paused via the new hooks. Disabling Bluetooth in config before OTA remains the stable path.
**Notes**:
- Recommendation: set `bluetooth_enabled=false` (or define `DISABLE_BLUETOOTH`) before OTA uploads, then re-enable afterwards for audio playback.
- The new runtime hook stays in place so we can revisit coexistence fixes later without reverting these code changes.

### Step 18: 2025-10-24 23:50 MDT ‚Äì Loop Guard During OTA
**Action**: Added `OTAManager::isUpdating()` and an early guard in `loop()` that, while OTA is in progress, runs only `WiFiManager::update()` and `OTAManager::update()` (ArduinoOTA.handle), sleeping the rest of the system. OTA start/stop callbacks now call `BluetoothController::pauseForOta()` / `resumeAfterOta()` so Bluetooth fully tears down during the transfer.
**Result**: **READY FOR TESTING** ‚Äì Builds succeed; with Bluetooth disabled (`bluetooth_enabled=false`) OTA uploads remain stable. Re-enabling Bluetooth still triggers the stack assert, but the new guard makes it easier to experiment with coexistence fixes later.

### Step 19: 2025-10-25 00:42 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth stack teardown refined
**Action**: Dug into the ESP32-A2DP library and identified that our OTA hook called `BluetoothA2DPSource::end(true)`, which frees controller memory (`esp_bt_controller_mem_release`) and makes subsequent restarts unstable. Reworked `BluetoothController::pauseForOta()/resumeAfterOta()` to keep memory allocated (`end(false)`), explicitly disable `esp_bluedroid` and the BT controller before OTA, and re-enable them afterward with state checks/timeouts. Verified the firmware compiles by running `pio run -e esp32dev`.
**Result**: **READY TO VERIFY ON HARDWARE** ‚Äì Build succeeds; OTA should now pause Bluetooth without crashing the stack, even when `bluetooth_enabled=true`.
**Notes**:
- Expect up to ~0.5‚ÄØs pause while the controller powers down; OTA progress bars may stall briefly at 0‚ÄØ% before bytes flow.
- Serial log should show the disable/enable path; capture it during the next OTA attempt to confirm both messages fire.
- `bluetooth_enabled` remains available as a fallback, but the runtime guard now handles full suspension so we can keep audio enabled by default.
- Next up: Re-run OTA with Bluetooth enabled, watch for `Guru Meditation` regressions, and stress-test multiple consecutive uploads.

### Step 20: 2025-10-25 01:08 MDT ‚Äì OTA smoke test (with Bluetooth on) still crashing
**Action**: Flashed latest firmware over USB, kicked off OTA while capturing USB serial. Observed the new guard fire (`‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing Bluetooth for OTA`) but the ESP32 still panicked at ~5‚ÄØ% (`InstrFetchProhibited`, PC=0x0) and rebooted. Backtrace pointed to callbacks firing after the A2DP instance was deleted.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì OTA aborts almost immediately; Bluetooth teardown still unsafe.
**Notes**:
- Library keeps global pointers (`actual_bluetooth_a2dp_common/source`) to the active object; deleting ours leaves stale callbacks that execute on freed memory.
- Crash timestamp logged in `/tmp/ota_serial_capture.log` for reference; OTA progress never exceeded 5‚ÄØ%.
- Needed to null those globals before releasing the instance, otherwise the ESP-IDF dispatchers jump to address 0x0.

### Step 21: 2025-10-25 01:24 MDT ‚Äì Nulling ESP32-A2DP globals restores OTA stability
**Action**: Declared the library globals in `bluetooth_controller.cpp` and set them to `nullptr` just after `a2dp_source->end(false)`; rebuilt both USB/OTA targets, reflashed via USB, then reran OTA with Bluetooth enabled while capturing serial. OTA progressed smoothly to 100‚ÄØ% and resumed Bluetooth without a crash.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA upload (Bluetooth active) completed in ~54‚ÄØs with logs: `‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing Bluetooth for OTA`, steady progress from 0‚Üí100‚ÄØ%, then `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resuming Bluetooth after OTA` plus a clean A2DP restart.
**Notes**:
- Removed the compile-time `-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` flag from `platformio.ini` so OTA builds exercise the full stack.
- Serial capture (`/tmp/ota_serial_capture.log`) contains the full success trace including bonded-device enumeration and connection retry restart.
- Next validation: run back-to-back OTA uploads to ensure repeated suspend/resume cycles stay stable and confirm the speaker re-pairs automatically after each update.

### Step 22: 2025-10-25 01:33 MDT ‚Äì Back-to-back OTA uncovers residual BTC_A2DP crash
**Action**: Immediately triggered a second OTA (Bluetooth left enabled) to stress-test consecutive updates. Capture shows the guard firing, but before OTA made progress the ESP32 hit `LoadProhibited` inside `btc_a2dp_cb_handler` (IDF `btc_av.c:1525`) and rebooted.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Second OTA attempt aborts with a Bluedroid callback dereferencing a null pointer.
**Notes**:
- Likely race between the library‚Äôs BTC task and our teardown while reconnection retries are still winding down. Need to wait for the BTC task queue to drain (or fully stop Bluetooth after the first OTA) before re-entering OTA.
- Next experiment: add an explicit wait for `BluetoothController::isRetryingConnection()` to clear (or skip auto-resume entirely until a manual trigger) before we allow another OTA session.

### Step 23: 2025-10-25 02:05 MDT ‚Äì Deferred Bluetooth resume guard
**Action**: Added a deferred resume mechanism that queues Bluetooth bring-up ~8‚ÄØs after OTA completion (or abort). `resumeAfterOta()` now schedules an exact resume time, `pauseForOta()` clears pending work, and `update()` checks `OTAManager::isUpdating()` so repeated uploads keep Bluetooth paused. Builds: `pio run -e esp32dev`, `pio run -e esp32dev_ota`.
**Result**: **READY FOR RETEST** ‚Äì Firmware compiles, new logs (`‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling Bluetooth resume‚Ä¶`) expected once OTA wraps.
**Notes**:
- Prevents Bluedroid callbacks from firing while the controller is still tearing down, and gives the human operator an 8‚ÄØs window to launch another OTA without the speaker reconnecting.
- Delay is centralized in the controller (`kResumeDelayMs`); adjust there if we need a longer/shorter window.
- Follow-up: run consecutive OTA uploads to confirm BTC crash is gone and check that Bluetooth auto-resumes after the timeout.

### Step 24: 2025-10-25 02:25 MDT ‚Äì Back-to-back OTA regression test
**Action**: Flashed latest firmware over USB, then executed two OTA uploads in succession with Bluetooth enabled while logging serial output.
**Result**:
- **Run 1** (00:43 MDT) ‚Äì OTA progressed to 24‚ÄØ% before the host reported `Error Uploading` (network hiccup). No crash, controller stayed paused.
- **Run 2** (00:45 MDT) ‚Äì OTA completed successfully (`Result: OK` at ~4‚ÄØmin 48‚ÄØs). Device rebooted cleanly and Wi-Fi stayed online.
**Notes**:
- After each attempt the controller stayed paused; Bluetooth retry logs only resumed once the deferred timer expired.
- Need an additional success capture that shows the scheduled resume log (current serial window ended before the 8‚ÄØs timer fired). Next manual test should keep the USB capture running a bit longer to confirm the new message.
- Overall behaviour: no Guru Meditation across consecutive uploads, but OTA transport still sensitive to Wi-Fi fluctuations (24‚ÄØ% failure). Consider monitoring RSSI or backing off upload rate if flaky network persists.

### Step 25: 2025-10-25 02:45 MDT ‚Äì Immediate retry still triggers BTC load fault
**Action**: Fired another OTA within ~10‚ÄØs of the prior success while capturing serial (`/tmp/ota_serial_capture4.log`). OTA handshake succeeded but the ESP32 panicked (`LoadProhibited` in `btc_a2dp_cb_handler`) before data transfer began.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Crash persists if the next OTA starts before Bluetooth has finished resuming/tearing down.
**Notes**:
- Despite the deferred resume guard we still delete the A2DP object mid-callback. Need a safer pause path‚Äîeither wait for `btc_a2dp_cb_handler` to drain before nulling the globals or keep the object alive (skip delete) and simply mute audio/stop retries during OTA.
- Until resolved, give the skull ~30‚ÄØs between OTA attempts (or toggle `bluetooth_enabled=false`) to avoid the BTC crash.

### Step 26: 2025-10-25 03:20 MDT ‚Äì Async disconnect wait + controller teardown refresh
**Action**: Reworked `pauseForOta()` to avoid blocking: request `disconnect()`, mark a wait flag, and defer the heavy `end(false)` + controller/bluedroid disable into a new `finalizePause()` that runs from `update()` once the link drops (or a timeout hits). Removed the temporary deletion of the A2DP object so ESP32-A2DP‚Äôs globals stay valid throughout the BTC callbacks. Reflashed via USB, then ran two OTA uploads back-to-back with Bluetooth enabled, capturing serial (`/tmp/ota_runA.log`, `/tmp/ota_runB.log`).
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Both OTA uploads completed (`Result: OK`), with logs showing `‚è∏Ô∏è Pausing‚Ä¶`, `üîª Disconnecting‚Ä¶` (once), and `‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling Bluetooth resume 8.0s after OTA`. No Guru Meditation or watchdog resets during the rapid second attempt.
**Notes**:
- The async path keeps ArduinoOTA responsive while waiting for the A2DP disconnect, eliminating the previous interrupt watchdog trip.
- Bluetooth resumes automatically after the firmware reboot; the deferred resume ensures we honour the post-OTA quiet window for scenarios where OTA aborts without a reset.
- Remaining OTA failures earlier in the night were due to Wi-Fi transport (timeouts at ~24‚ÄØ%); with the new guard the stack stays alive for immediate retries, so future tuning can focus on improving Wi-Fi reliability instead of Bluetooth crashes.

### Step 27: 2025-10-25 03:30 MDT ‚Äì Remove hardcoded OTA IP
**Action**: Pointed `platformio.ini`‚Äôs `esp32dev_ota` `upload_port` to `${sysenv.DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST}` and refreshed `docs/ota.md` instructions. Discovery scripts (`scripts/discover_esp32.py`, `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto`) already emit the export command, so operators just need to source the variable or use the auto-upload task.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì No more stale IPs in version control; the existing workflow now feeds PlatformIO directly. Attempting an OTA without the variable set still fails fast, so docs emphasize running discovery first.
**Notes**:
- Keeps the repo agnostic to DHCP churn.
- Future enhancement: wrap `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto` as the default VS Code task so manual exports are optional.

### Step 28: 2025-10-25 11:42 MDT ‚Äì OTA invite timeouts on 192.168.86.46
**Action**: Exported `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.46` (from discovery output) and ran `python scripts/flash_and_monitor.py --mode ota --capture serial --strict --seconds 80`. PlatformIO built the OTA image successfully and attempted upload with `host_ip=192.168.86.28`.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì `espota.py` retried invitations for ~7‚ÄØmin before reporting `No response from the ESP`. Script exited with error 1.
**Notes**:
- Serial capture never engaged because the OTA invite never completed; no reboot observed.
- Serial polling afterwards showed the skull still advertising Wi-Fi at `192.168.86.49`, so the target likely moved off `.46` between discovery and upload.
- Need non-interactive way to refresh `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` immediately before invoking OTA so the automation doesn‚Äôt chase stale leases.

### Step 29: 2025-10-25 11:50 MDT ‚Äì OTA invite failures on 192.168.86.49
**Action**: Re-ran `scripts/discover_esp32.py` (reported `.46` active, `.49` stale), force-set `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49`, and repeated the OTA helper script.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Build succeeded again but `espota.py` errored with `Host 192.168.86.49 Not Found` after the UDP invitation phase (timeout ~6‚ÄØmin).
**Notes**:
- Serial console kept logging `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49)` every 5‚ÄØs, confirming the ESP32 stayed online during the attempt.
- `ping` alternated between full packet loss and 200‚ÄØms replies, suggesting marginal RSSI (serial shows ‚àí75 to ‚àí80‚ÄØdBm).
- Telnet helper (`scripts/telnet_command.py`) cannot complete the password exchange in this environment because it expects interactive prompts; connections drop right after the ESP prints ‚ÄúRemoteDebug connected‚Äù.

### Step 30: 2025-10-25 12:09 MDT ‚Äì Direct PlatformIO OTA with serial tail
**Action**: Launched `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` while tailing USB serial in a parallel thread to capture OTA log output.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì PlatformIO (now auto-upgraded to Core 6.12.0) still reported `Host 192.168.86.49 Not Found` after ~2.5‚ÄØmin of invitations; the ESP never accepted the TCP session so no reboot happened.
**Notes**:
- Serial feed during the run showed normal status heartbeats (free heap slowly dropping to ~12‚ÄØKB) but no `OTA:` progress lines, confirming ArduinoOTA `handle()` never saw the upload.
- Manual UDP probe (`socket.sendto()` replicating espota invite) also timed out, reinforcing that the device isn‚Äôt answering port 3232 from the Mac‚Äôs IP.
- Because I can‚Äôt interactively acknowledge telnet/password prompts, I can‚Äôt toggle RemoteDebug streaming off mid-upload; need a scripted command or config flag to keep that service quiet so OTA has fewer sockets to juggle.

### Step 31: 2025-10-25 12:24 MDT ‚Äì USB reset baseline
**Action**: Toggled DTR/RTS on `/dev/cu.usbserial-10` to reset the ESP32 and captured the full boot log over serial to verify baseline behaviour post-OTA attempts.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Skull reinitialized cleanly, reported `OTA manager started (port 3232)` and resumed Bluetooth retries; no crash or brownout detected.
**Notes**:
- Confirms USB flashing/reset path still works, so the stalled OTA is network-side.
- Boot log reiterates strong dependence on Wi-Fi RSSI (‚àí80‚ÄØdBm). Consider moving the router or adding a temporary antenna to improve invite responsiveness.
- Next experiment: temporarily disable Bluetooth in `config.txt` or via telnet command once a non-interactive pathway exists, to see if freeing RAM/socket slots lets ArduinoOTA reply on the first invite.

### Step 32: 2025-10-25 13:16 MDT ‚Äì Post-reboot status check
**Action**: After the user power-cycled the skull, captured 10‚ÄØs of USB serial output to verify the new network state before attempting OTA.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Logs show `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49)` with free heap ~16‚ÄØKB; Bluetooth still retrying.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the ESP32 is back online on `.49`; no immediate OTA or telnet actions performed yet per request.
- RSSI message not present in the short capture, but previous boot logs showed ‚àí75 to ‚àí80‚ÄØdBm‚Äîworth monitoring if invites keep timing out.

### Step 33: 2025-10-25 13:18 MDT ‚Äì OTA retry after reboot
**Action**: Set `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49` and ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` while tailing USB serial to watch for OTA callbacks.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì `espota.py` logged `Host 192.168.86.49 Not Found` after ~90‚ÄØs of invitations; the device never opened the TCP data socket, and no `OTA:` progress lines appeared on serial. PlatformIO also emitted a benign `.sconsign` temp-file warning while unwinding the failed job.
**Notes**:
- Serial heartbeats continued every ~5‚ÄØs with Wi-Fi connected, so the ESP32 stayed online and did not reboot.
- Invitation failure persists even immediately after the board reboot; suggests the UDP packet isn‚Äôt reaching ArduinoOTA (network loss or service saturation).
- Next step: keep OTA focus (no telnet usage) and consider increasing invite retries/timeout or improving Wi-Fi signal to get past the initial handshake.

### Step 34: 2025-10-25 13:21 MDT ‚Äì Connectivity spot-check
**Action**: Issued `ping -c 5 192.168.86.49` from the Mac, then rechecked USB serial output.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Ping reported `Host is down` with 100‚ÄØ% packet loss, yet the skull‚Äôs serial status immediately afterwards still claimed `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49)`.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the ESP32 believes it‚Äôs on Wi-Fi while the host can‚Äôt reach it‚Äîlikely severe packet loss or a stale DHCP association in the Google/Nest mesh.
- Will hold off on telnet and instead focus on getting the network path stable enough for OTA invites to succeed.

### Step 35: 2025-10-25 13:24 MDT ‚Äì Discovery vs. device logs mismatch
**Action**: Ran `python scripts/discover_esp32.py --quiet` to refresh the active IP list, then pinged the recommended address.
**Result**: **MIXED** ‚Äì Discovery identified 192.168.86.46 as the active ESP32 (telnet reachable), and `ping` to `.46` returned 0‚ÄØ% loss (~30‚ÄØms RTT). USB serial, however, continues to report `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49)`.
**Notes**:
- `brw28565a69921b.lan` resolves to a Brother printer, so the telnet-positive `.46` might actually be that peripheral rather than the skull; nevertheless, it is the only host responding quickly.
- Next OTA attempt will still target `.46` in case the skull truly migrated, but serial monitoring will confirm whether the ESP32 ever accepts the invite.

### Step 36: 2025-10-25 13:28 MDT ‚Äì OTA invite against 192.168.86.46
**Action**: Exported `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.46` and reran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` with a serial tail.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì After ~7‚ÄØmin of retries `espota.py` reported `No response from the ESP`. Serial heartbeats kept advertising `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49)`, indicating the MCU never saw the OTA start hook.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the UDP invite still isn‚Äôt reaching ArduinoOTA even on the freshly pingable `.46`; possible that the ESP32 hasn‚Äôt truly migrated off `.49` despite the discovery scan.
- With OTA blocked at the invitation stage for both candidate IPs, the next move is to firm up which address the board is actually using (e.g., inspect DHCP table or add a debug print in `WiFiManager` for `WiFi.localIP()` each loop) before launching another upload.

### Step 37: 2025-10-25 13:33 MDT ‚Äì Add RSSI/IP instrumentation
**Action**: Updated `src/main.cpp` to print `WiFi.RSSI()` alongside the current IP in the 5‚ÄØs status heartbeat, then prepared to reflash over USB for ground truth on signal strength.
**Result**: **IN PROGRESS** ‚Äì Code change staged locally; next step is `pio run -e esp32dev -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-10` to deploy the instrumentation.
**Notes**:
- Expecting the enhanced log to confirm whether the skull is clinging to a weak association (e.g., ‚àí80‚ÄØdBm) which would explain the dropped OTA invites.
- Leaving telnet untouched per instructions; only USB flashing and serial monitoring are in play.

### Step 38: 2025-10-25 13:36 MDT ‚Äì RSSI confirmed after USB flash
**Action**: Flashed the instrumented build via USB (`pio run -e esp32dev -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-10`) and tailed serial output.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Boot log now reports `WiFiManager: RSSI: -76dBm` and heartbeat lines show `WiFi: connected (192.168.86.49) RSSI: -76dBm`. RemoteDebug also noted an automatic client connection from 192.168.86.28 immediately after boot.
**Notes**:
- Signal quality remains borderline (mid ‚àí70s), matching the earlier suspicion that OTA invites are getting lost when the link degrades further.
- Despite the RSSI readout, `ping` from the Mac to `.49` still times out, so the network path is asymmetric‚Äîlikely the mesh routing toward the Mac is flaky while outbound traffic from the skull occasionally succeeds.

### Step 39: 2025-10-25 13:34 MDT ‚Äì OTA retry with RSSI telemetry
**Action**: With `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49`, reran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` while the new status messages streamed RSSI values (‚àí77 to ‚àí83‚ÄØdBm).
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì `espota.py` again reported `Host 192.168.86.49 Not Found` after ~100‚ÄØs of invitations. Serial never printed the OTA start hook; Wi-Fi RSSI hovered <‚àí80‚ÄØdBm just before each failure.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the board is clinging to a very weak link; every invite attempt coincided with RSSI dips, supporting the theory that UDP packets are dropping before ArduinoOTA can acknowledge them.
- Next mitigation: reduce load on the Wi-Fi stack (e.g., temporarily disable Bluetooth retries) or physically improve signal strength before reattempting OTA.

### Step 40: 2025-10-25 13:39 MDT ‚Äì Disable Bluetooth to lighten Wi-Fi load
**Action**: Added `-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` to both PlatformIO environments so the next USB flash skips A2DP entirely (no connection retries while OTA is in progress).
**Result**: **IN PROGRESS** ‚Äì Build flags updated; preparing to reflash to confirm the skull boots with Bluetooth fully disabled.
**Notes**:
- Expectation: reduced RF contention and lower heap usage should make ArduinoOTA more responsive on a marginal RSSI link.
- Will remove the flag once OTA stability is confirmed so audio can return.

### Step 41: 2025-10-25 13:44 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth-disabled build verified
**Action**: Flashed the new `DISABLE_BLUETOOTH` build via USB and captured the post-boot heartbeat.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Status log now shows `A2DP connected: false, Retrying: false` with free heap ~112‚ÄØKB (previously ~9‚ÄØKB) while Wi-Fi remains at 192.168.86.49, RSSI ‚âà ‚àí80‚ÄØdBm.
**Notes**:
- With Bluetooth idle, the ESP32 has ~100‚ÄØKB more headroom; if OTA still fails the culprit is likely pure RF reachability rather than heap pressure.
- Proceeding with another OTA attempt immediately while the link is quiet.

### Step 42: 2025-10-25 13:38 MDT ‚Äì OTA succeeds with Bluetooth disabled
**Action**: Ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` (target 192.168.86.49) after disabling Bluetooth. Serial tail captured `OTAManager: Progress ‚Ä¶` messages.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA completed in ~85‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`), triggering an automatic reboot. The new firmware booted from OTA slot without USB intervention.
**Notes**:
- Progress logs marched from 0‚ÄØ% to 100‚ÄØ% with no invite timeouts, confirming that shedding Bluetooth load and reclaiming heap resolved the handshake failures.
- Next steps: restore Bluetooth (remove `DISABLE_BLUETOOTH`) and repeat OTA to verify the pause/resume guard still works, or leave it disabled if OTA sessions will remain the priority today.

### Step 43: 2025-10-25 13:44 MDT ‚Äì Wall-power OTA attempt #1
**Action**: With the skull unplugged from USB and running on wall power, ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` using `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49`.
**Result**: **FAILED @ 26‚ÄØ%** ‚Äì Transfer aborted with `Error Uploading` after steady progress; ESP remained online (pings responded) but OTA did not resume.
**Notes**:
- Even without Bluetooth, occasional packet loss still interrupts the stream; left everything untouched and immediately retried.
- Discovery still reports `.49` as active; no need to reset the board between attempts.

### Step 44: 2025-10-25 13:47 MDT ‚Äì Wall-power OTA attempt #2
**Action**: Re-ran `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` (same target).
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA completed in ~125‚ÄØs and rebooted (`Result: OK`). This confirms the first failure was transient RF loss.
**Notes**:
- Post-reboot pings showed 700‚Äì1700‚ÄØms latency but no drops‚Äînetwork is noisy yet usable.
- Prepared a second back-to-back OTA to satisfy the ‚Äútwo in a row‚Äù requirement.

### Step 45: 2025-10-25 13:50 MDT ‚Äì Wall-power OTA attempt #3
**Action**: Immediately launched a second OTA upload after the successful reboot (still wall powered, Bluetooth disabled).
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA finished in ~157‚ÄØs with another clean reboot (`Result: OK`).
**Notes**:
- Achieved two consecutive OTA successes under wall-power conditions.
- Recommend leaving Bluetooth disabled during future OTA runs unless signal quality improves; once testing is done, remove `-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` to restore audio features.

### Step 46: 2025-10-25 14:11 MDT ‚Äì Auto-discovery regression
**Action**: Tried `scripts/ota_upload_auto.py` on the perfboard setup after moving the skull; script rewrote `platformio.ini` with `upload_port = 192.168.86.46`, then attempted a build.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Toolchain invocation ran outside the PlatformIO environment (clang errors, missing headers) and OTA never started. Also proved that `.46` corresponds to a different host (welcome prompt, no OTA) while the skull still lives at `.49`.
**Notes**:
- Restored `upload_port` to `${sysenv.DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST}` to avoid future mismatches.
- Will stick to direct `pio run` invocations for now.

### Step 47: 2025-10-25 14:20 MDT ‚Äì Perfboard OTA run #1
**Action**: With `upload_port` restored and `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49`, executed `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload`.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA completed in ~59‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`).
**Notes**:
- Confirms the skull still responds at `.49` even without USB connected.
- Bluetooth remains disabled, keeping free heap >110‚ÄØKB and eliminating retry chatter.

### Step 48: 2025-10-25 14:21 MDT ‚Äì Perfboard OTA run #2
**Action**: Immediately repeated the OTA upload (same host/IP).
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì OTA finished in ~42‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`), delivering the required two back-to-back successes on wall power with the perfboard wiring.
**Notes**:
- Perfboard scenario meets the acceptance criteria for OTA reliability without USB.
- Next follow-up is optional: re-enable Bluetooth and reconfirm once the network is stable.

### Step 49: 2025-10-25 14:23 MDT ‚Äì Post-update discovery check
**Action**: Ran the enhanced `scripts/discover_esp32.py --quiet` to confirm it flags only the skull as active.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Output now lists 27 devices but only 192.168.86.49 shows `ACTIVE Telnet:‚úÖ OTA:‚úÖ`; the Brother printer at .46 is demoted to `TELNET`.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the discovery improvements worked; discovery output includes both telnet/OTA readiness flags for clarity.

### Step 50: 2025-10-25 14:32 MDT ‚Äì OTA validation run #1 (post-tooling updates)
**Action**: With `platformio.ini` back on `${sysenv.DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST}` and discovery confirming `.49`, executed `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49 pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload`.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Transfer completed in ~86‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`) and the skull rebooted cleanly on wall power.
**Notes**:
- Confirms the revised scripts + docs workflow works end-to-end.
- No Bluetooth retries present; free heap remains ~110‚ÄØKB during the run.

### Step 51: 2025-10-25 14:34 MDT ‚Äì OTA validation run #2
**Action**: Immediately repeated the manual OTA command with the same environment.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Second upload wrapped in ~38‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`), meeting the ‚Äútwo consecutive‚Äù requirement after the documentation/tooling changes.
**Notes**:
- OTA stability looks excellent with Bluetooth disabled; next story will tackle re-enabling audio without sacrificing reliability.

### Step 52: 2025-10-25 14:36 MDT ‚Äì Remove compile-time Bluetooth disable
**Action**: Dropped `-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` from both PlatformIO environments so Bluetooth/A2DP will initialize again on the next build.
**Result**: **IN PROGRESS** ‚Äì Ready to verify whether OTA remains reliable with Bluetooth active.
**Notes**:
- Next steps: run consecutive OTA uploads using the manual flow (`discover_esp32.py`, export `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST`, `pio run ‚Ä¶`) and monitor for regressions.

### Step 53: 2025-10-25 14:37 MDT ‚Äì Rediscovery before Bluetooth-on tests
**Action**: Re-ran `scripts/discover_esp32.py --quiet` after removing the flag to confirm the skull is still at the expected IP.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Discovery shows only 192.168.86.49 as `ACTIVE Telnet:‚úÖ OTA:‚úÖ`; `.46` remains tagged `TELNET`.
**Notes**:
- Using this IP for the upcoming OTA runs so we don‚Äôt chase the printer again.

### Step 54: 2025-10-25 14:39 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth-on OTA attempt #1
**Action**: Executed `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49 pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload` with Bluetooth back in the build.
**Result**: **SUCCESS** ‚Äì Transfer completed in ~111‚ÄØs (`Result: OK`), confirming OTA still works with Bluetooth enabled.
**Notes**:
- Build output shows the Bluetooth controller recompiled; status logs (captured earlier) now include retry activity again.

### Step 55: 2025-10-25 14:40 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth-on OTA attempt #2
**Action**: Immediately re-ran the OTA upload command.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì `espota.py` reported `No response from device` about 10‚ÄØs into the session (after auth). No serial console available to inspect Bluetooth activity.
**Notes**:
- Likely timing/race between the controller resuming and the next OTA invite. Will pause a few seconds before the next attempt to let Bluetooth settle.

### Step 56: 2025-10-25 14:48 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth-on OTA attempt #3 (with 10‚ÄØs pause)
**Action**: Waited ~10‚ÄØs, then launched another OTA upload to 192.168.86.49.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì After ~7‚ÄØmin of invitations the host logged `No response from the ESP` (auth succeeded but the data socket never opened).
**Notes**:
- Evidently the ESP32 isn‚Äôt answering OTA invites reliably once Bluetooth resumes. Need to quiet RemoteDebug/Bluetooth traffic before attempting the next pair of uploads.

### Step 57: 2025-10-25 14:50 MDT ‚Äì Bluetooth-on OTA attempt #4 (after ~40‚ÄØs pause)
**Action**: Slept ~40‚ÄØs to let Bluetooth settle, then retried the OTA upload.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì `Host 192.168.86.49 Not Found` after the invite phase; subsequent attempts to run `telnet_command.py stream off` also timed out / reported ‚ÄúHost is down‚Äù.
**Notes**:
- The skull may have roamed to a new IP mid-test or the Wi-Fi link is collapsing when Bluetooth is active; need fresh discovery and possibly to pause RemoteDebug via the new helper once we locate the device again.

### Step 58: 2025-10-25 14:52 MDT ‚Äì Device unreachable
**Action**: Ran discovery again; no `ACTIVE` device found. `arp -a` shows `death-fortune-teller.lan (192.168.86.49) at (incomplete)`.
**Result**: **FAILED** ‚Äì Pings to 192.168.86.49 return `Host is down`. The skull appears offline (likely reboot loop or Wi-Fi drop) after the previous failed OTA attempts.
**Notes**:
- Awaiting hardware reset or reconnection before continuing Bluetooth-on tests.

### Step 59: 2025-10-25 14:55 MDT ‚Äì Next steps
**Action**: Paused active testing while the skull is offline; prepared to tackle telnet automation so Bluetooth can be toggled before OTA.
**Result**: **PENDING** ‚Äì Will resume once the board is reachable again (power cycle may be required).
**Notes**:
- Priority for the next session: establish a reliable telnet command path (`status`, `stream off`, `bluetooth disable/enable`) to eliminate manual intervention when Bluetooth is active.

### Step 8: ESP32 Reflash and OTA Test
**Action**: Reflashed ESP32 via USB with current firmware, tested OTA upload
**Result**: **MAJOR SUCCESS** - OTA service now responding!
**Key Success Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Authentication successful: "Authenticating...OK"
- ‚úÖ Connection established: "Waiting for device..."
- ‚úÖ Upload progress: Reached 64% before failing
- ‚úÖ OTA service responding: No more "No response from the ESP"

**Upload failed at 64% with "Error Uploading"** - This is a network stability issue, not an OTA service issue.

## Current Status

- ESP32: Online and reachable
- WiFi: Connected with proper credentials  
- Telnet: Working with password authentication
- OTA Service: **WORKING** - Authentication and connection successful
- Partition Layout: Optimized and correct
- Network: No firewall issues
- **Issue**: Upload fails at 64% - likely network stability or timeout issue

## Known Relevant Details

- **SPIFFS Partition**: NOT required for OTA updates. Only need two OTA partitions (ota_0, ota_1)
- **Firewall**: User has no firewall, and OTA worked previously
- **WiFi Config**: Properly configured on SD card with credentials
- **Partition Layout**: Current layout is sufficient for OTA (no SPIFFS needed)
- **Previous Success**: OTA uploading worked before, broke today
- **ESP32 Connectivity**: ESP32 is online, telnet works, WiFi connected
- **Port 3232**: OTA service not responding on this port

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Initial OTA Failure Investigation
**Action**: Tested OTA upload, got "No response from the ESP"
**Result**: FAILED - OTA service not responding
**Why Failed**: Unknown at time

### Step 2: Telnet Authentication Fix
**Action**: Modified `scripts/telnet_command.py` to handle password authentication
**Result**: SUCCESS - Telnet connections now work with password
**Why This Didn't Fix OTA**: Telnet and OTA are separate services

### Step 3: ESP32 IP Address Discovery
**Action**: Used discovery scripts to find ESP32 IP, updated `platformio.ini`
**Result**: SUCCESS - Found ESP32 at 192.168.86.46, updated config
**Why This Didn't Fix OTA**: IP was correct, issue was deeper

### Step 4: Partition Size Investigation
**Action**: Checked partition sizes, found 199% flash usage, increased OTA partition sizes
**Result**: SUCCESS - Optimized partition layout (94.4% usage, 300KB+ free space)
**Why This Didn't Fix OTA**: Partition layout was correct, issue was in firmware

### Step 5: ESP32 Reflash with New Partitions
**Action**: Reflashed ESP32 via USB with corrected partition layout
**Result**: SUCCESS - ESP32 booted with new partitions
**Why This Didn't Fix OTA**: Partition layout wasn't the root cause

### Step 6: Auto-Discovery System Test
**Action**: Used `python scripts/ota_upload_auto.py` to test auto-discovery OTA
**Result**: FAILED - Still "No response from the ESP"
**Why This Didn't Fix OTA**: Auto-discovery works, but OTA service still not responding

### Step 7: Code Analysis and Syntax Error Discovery
**Action**: Analyzed `src/main.cpp` for initialization issues
**Result**: **CRITICAL BUG FOUND** - Missing opening brace `{` on line 259
**Code Issue**:
```cpp
if (wifiSSID.length() > 0 && wifiPassword.length() > 0)  // Missing {
    LOG_INFO(WIFI_TAG, "Initializing Wi-Fi manager");
    // ... WiFi initialization code never executes
```

**Impact**: This syntax error prevents WiFi initialization code from executing, which means:
- WiFi connection callback never runs
- OTA service never gets initialized
- Port 3232 never opens
- OTA uploads fail with "No response from the ESP"

## Root Cause Identified

**Primary Issue**: Syntax error in `main.cpp` line 259 - missing opening brace `{` after if statement

**Secondary Issues**: None identified. All other systems (WiFi config, partitions, network) are working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Fix syntax error in `main.cpp` line 259
2. Reflash ESP32 with corrected code
3. Test OTA upload functionality

## Files Modified During Debugging

- `scripts/telnet_command.py` - Added password authentication
- `partitions/fortune_ota.csv` - Optimized partition layout
- `platformio.ini` - Updated IP address (dynamic via scripts)
