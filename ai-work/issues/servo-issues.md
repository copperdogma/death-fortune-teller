**Domain Overview:**  
The servo controller subsystem manages jaw movement for the Death Fortune Teller skull using a HS-125MG servo. It handles audio-synchronized jaw animation and a breathing idle cycle. Recent work has implemented hard microsecond limits to prevent servo damage, using writeMicroseconds() with constraint enforcement. Current critical issue: servo swinging wildly during initialization and exceeding safe limits.

**Subsystems / Components:**  
- ServoController class — Broken — Wild swinging during initialization, exceeds safe limits

## 20250123-UNKNOWN: Servo Stepping/Jerky Motion During Breathing Cycle

**Description:**  
The servo breathing animation displays noticeable stepping/jerky motion when using ESP32Servo library, while the TwoSkulls reference implementation (using Arduino Servo.h) produces perfectly smooth motion with identical code logic. Despite implementing timing-based interpolation with easing functions and trying various update rates (10ms, 20ms, continuous), the motion remains visibly stepped.

**Environment:**  
- Platform: ESP32-WROVER on perfboard
- Framework: PlatformIO with Arduino framework
- Servo Library: ESP32Servo@3.0.9
- Reference: TwoSkulls uses Arduino IDE with <Servo.h>
- Servo: Hitec HS-125MG

**Evidence:**
- TwoSkulls implementation is "perfectly smooth" per user testing
- Current implementation is "jerky" and shows "visible steps"
- Both use identical smoothMove() timing logic (startTime/currentTime/endTime)
- Both use 20ms delays and linear interpolation
- Key difference: TwoSkulls uses `servo.write(servoPin, degrees)` while ESP32Servo uses `servo.write(degrees)`

### Step 1 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Initial Analysis and Code Comparison
**Action**: Compared TwoSkulls servo_controller.cpp with current src/servo_controller.cpp implementations.

**Result**: 
- Identical smoothMove() logic: timing-based interpolation with 20ms delays
- Key difference in setPosition():
  - TwoSkulls: `servo.write(servoPin, constrainedDegrees)`
  - Current: `servo.write(constrainedDegrees)` (ESP32Servo only supports single-arg)
- Both use servo.attach(servoPin) with no special pulse width configuration

**Notes**:
- ESP32Servo appears to be a different library than Arduino's Servo.h
- The write() signature difference suggests different PWM generation mechanisms
- Attempted fixes (writeMicroseconds, easing, update rates) suggest the issue is in how ESP32Servo generates PWM rather than our interpolation logic

**Next Steps**: Research Arduino Servo.h implementation to understand PWM generation differences and find migration path to smoother control.


**20251025 Research by GPT5**

I did some digging into both the classic Servo library (Arduino AVR/Arduino core) and the ESP32Servo library for ESP32, with the goal of finding exactly how the Arduino library achieves smooth motion (or appears to) and where the ESP32 library may diverge (leading to the stepped/jerky behaviour you observe). Here is a summary of what I found, followed by my analysis of why you may be seeing the difference.

⸻

1. Arduino Servo library (AVR / Arduino core) — key implementation points

I couldn’t locate a full easily-searchable version of the Servo.cpp inside the ESP32 Arduino core (because the ESP32 core often uses its own hardware PWM implementations rather than the original AVR approach). But I found enough commentary and excerpts of the original AVR-library to infer how it works. (A published analysis: “Arduino’s Servo Library: Angles, Microseconds, and ‘Optional’ Command Parameters” covers this.  ￼)

Here are the key aspects:
	•	The library exposes Servo::write(angle) (0-180 degrees) and Servo::writeMicroseconds(us) (direct pulse width) APIs.  ￼
	•	Internally, write(angle) maps the angle to a pulse width between a minimum and maximum microsecond value. The default min/max are 544 µs and 2400 µs if you use attach(pin) without specifying min/max.  ￼
	•	Example mapping (approx):

pulseWidth_us = map(angle, 0, 180, min_us, max_us);  

Where min_us = 544, max_us = 2400 (unless overridden via attach(pin, min_us, max_us)).  ￼

	•	For AVR platforms, the library sets up a timer interrupt (or multiple timers) that generate servo pulses at a refresh interval (typically ~20 ms, i.e. ~50 Hz) per servo channel. In the servo library source we see macros like:

#define usToTicks(_us) ((clockCyclesPerMicrosecond()* _us) / 8)  // etc.  

￼

	•	Because the library uses timer interrupts and distributes multiple servo pulses in sequence, it effectively multiplexes the pulses so that each servo gets its pulse in each 20 ms window, and the rest of the time is idle.
	•	The write/update to the pulse width simply writes a value into a data structure; the actual hardware pulses continue to be generated in the background via the timer ISR. There is no interpolation (ramping) built into the base library: the library simply sets the target pulse width and the servo receives that width on the next refresh.
	•	Because the servo internal mechanism (gear + potentiometer feedback) takes some time to physically move the shaft, the motion can appear smooth if the changes in angle are small and the refresh is frequent relative to the physical movement. Users essentially rely on the mechanical inertia of the servo to smooth the motion.
	•	The article notes:
“The write method simply maps the degrees to microseconds and calls the writeMicroseconds method anyway.”  ￼
	•	One relevant snippet (from the AVR library) is:

#if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR)
…
#define usToTicks(_us) (( clockCyclesPerMicrosecond()* _us) / 8)
…
static servo_t servos[MAX_SERVOS];
…

This shows the lower‐level interrupt/tick conversion.  ￼

	•	Because the library uses hardware timers and interrupt service routines (ISRs) which run even if the main loop is busy, the servo pulses are fairly regular and jitter is kept low (assuming nothing else blocks interrupts for long). That regularity helps motion appear smooth.

Summary for Arduino Servo library
	•	Maps degrees → microsecond pulse width via map().
	•	Uses hardware timers and interrupts to send a steady ~50 Hz pulse train.
	•	No built‐in interpolation/ramping; smoothness depends on how often write() is called and mechanical inertia.
	•	Good precision (on AVR) because pulses delivered at regular refresh intervals; minimal steps between successive widths if angle changes small.

⸻

2. ESP32Servo library (ESP32) — key implementation points

Here’s what I found in the library source (via GitHub and documentation) for ESP32Servo, which tries to mimic the Arduino API.  ￼

Key points:
	•	From the source excerpt (ESP32Servo.cpp) we see:

Servo::Servo()
{
  REFRESH_CPS = 50;
  this->ticks = DEFAULT_PULSE_WIDTH_TICKS;
  this->timer_width = DEFAULT_TIMER_WIDTH;
  this->pinNumber = -1;
  this->min = DEFAULT_uS_LOW;
  this->max = DEFAULT_uS_HIGH;
  this->timer_width_ticks = pow(2,this->timer_width);
}

￼

	•	The comments in the code say:
“Different servos require different pulse widths … an approximately 500-2500 microsecond pulse every 20ms (50Hz). … The ESP32 PWM timers allow us to set the timer width (max 20 bits). Thus … count = (pulse_high_width / (pulse_period/2**timer_width))”  ￼
	•	The attach logic:

int Servo::attach(int pin)
{
  return (this->attach(pin, DEFAULT_uS_LOW, DEFAULT_uS_HIGH));
}
int Servo::attach(int pin, int min, int max)
{
  // …
  this->min = min;
  this->max = max;
  // setup LEDC / PWM for ESP32
  pwm.setup(pin, REFRESH_CPS, timer_width);  
  pwm.write(pin, ticks);  
  this->pinNumber = pin;
  return pin;
}

(simplified)  ￼

	•	The write method (excerpt) roughly:

void Servo::write(int value)
{
  int pulseWidth_us;
  if (value < MIN_PULSE_WIDTH) {
    // treat value as microseconds
    pulseWidth_us = value;
  } else {
    // treat value as degrees
    pulseWidth_us = map(value, 0, 180, min, max);
  }
  this->writeMicroseconds(pulseWidth_us);
}

And in writeMicroseconds:

void Servo::writeMicroseconds(int value_us)
{
  if (value_us < min) value_us = min;
  else if (value_us > max) value_us = max;
  ticks = (long)( (value_us) / (pulse_period_us / timer_width_ticks) );
  pwm.write(pinNumber, ticks);
}

(where pulse_period_us is e.g. 20000 µs for 50 Hz)  ￼

	•	The important difference: it uses the LEDC (ESP32 hardware PWM) API (ledcSetup, ledcWrite, etc) which is not interrupt‐driven in the same way as the AVR library, but uses hardware PWM channels.

Summary for ESP32Servo library
	•	It maps degrees → microseconds → tick count using a formula based on hardware timer width.
	•	It uses the ESP32 LEDC hardware PWM once to configure frequency and duty cycle (no per‐servo ISR multiplexing).
	•	Each write() call effectively updates the duty (tick count) for the PWM channel corresponding to the servo pin.
	•	No built‐in interpolation/ramping either; you set a target angle and the library translates that to the appropriate duty.

⸻

3. Comparison & implications for smoothness

Based on the above, here are the key differences and how they might translate to the behaviour you observe (Arduino library “perfectly smooth” vs ESP32Servo “stepped/jerky” under identical input sequences).

a) Refresh mechanism / pulse generation
	•	Arduino library uses a fixed refresh interval (~20 ms) via timer interrupts. Every servo gets one pulse per refresh. Because this is hardware‐timer based and interrupts ensure regular delivery, successive pulses for a given servo are evenly spaced.
	•	ESP32Servo uses hardware PWM LEDC channels which continuously output the configured duty at the set frequency (50 Hz) without needing interrupts to start/stop each pulse. This is good in principle — less CPU overhead — but it does mean that the resolution of the hardware PWM channel (timer width + tick resolution) and how frequently you call write() become more significant.

b) Mapping resolution
	•	On Arduino, the mapping is simple: degrees → µs, and the timer tick conversion is tuned for the AVR timers. Because the servo is physically slow, small changes in pulse width may not result in noticeable jumps, leading to seemingly smooth motion.
	•	On ESP32Servo, the mapping is also degrees → µs → ticks (for LEDC). But the tick resolution is determined by timer_width (e.g., a 16-bit width means some quantisation of pulse width). Also, if your input sequence jumps angle values significantly, the change in duty will also be significant and instantaneous (from one refresh to the next). The “stepped” appearance may come from the servo physically moving, but the library causing discrete changes in pulse width without smoothing.

c) Interpolation / ramping
	•	Neither library (by default) implements interpolation (i.e., ramping from current angle to target angle over many steps). Motion smoothness is thus chiefly dependent on:
	1.	how frequent you call write() (if you update many times per refresh cycle)
	2.	how large the jump in angle is per write()
	3.	the servo’s own mechanical inertia/filtering
	•	Because the Arduino library likely had simpler loads and lower performance demands historically, many users implicitly called write() slowly (delay between writes) and hence got smooth motion. With ESP32, you may be calling write() with large increments or quickly, making the motion visibly “stepped”.

d) Jitter and update frequency
	•	On AVR the pulses are very regular as they are handled by an ISR; even if the main loop is busy, the timer still fires. That regularity reduces jitter and gives consistent motion.
	•	On ESP32, though LEDC is hardware PWM and thus regular, the actual servo movement depends on how smoothly you transition the target. If you call write() with big jumps and fast intervals, the hardware will simply adjust to the new duty for the next cycle — but the servo may catch up only slowly, causing a “stair‐case” effect.

e) Default pulse width ranges & calibrations
	•	The Arduino library defaults of 544 µs to 2400 µs give a larger “span” of possible pulse widths; if you use the default and many servos only require 1000-2000 µs, the mapping becomes less granular (i.e., more µs per degree), which can smooth out visible steps (because each degree change results in a relatively small µs change).
	•	On ESP32Servo you might be specifying attach(pin, 1000, 2000) or using defaults; but if the tick resolution is coarse, you might get fewer distinct tick values for the range, making motion appear more stepped.

⸻

4. Why you might see “perfectly smooth” on Arduino and “jerky/stepped” on ESP32Servo

Given all of the above, here’s a likely explanation in your context:
	•	On Arduino (or when using the classic Servo library on compatible boards) the combination of regular refresh, relatively fine control, and mechanical smoothing may mask discrete jumps — if you only call write() when angle changes slowly (or you include a delay between updates). The servo motion naturally filters the discrete pulses.
	•	On ESP32 with ESP32Servo, if your input sequence is calling write() with many small increments (or maybe even large increments) very quickly, then each update leads to a discrete jump in duty width which the servo tries to follow. Because there is no interpolation inside the library, and perhaps because the tick resolution or update timing is coarser than the servo’s mechanical time constant, you see visible stepping.
	•	In effect: you may be changing target angles faster than the servo and the driver can “smooth out”.
	•	Also if your update frequency (calls per second) is high and your duty resolution is coarse, each increment may be just a few ticks, so the servo moves a little, waits until the next pulse, moves a little again — which looks like stepping.
	•	Finally, the difference may be perceptual rather than strictly library‐driven: small jumps at high speed vs slower updates will feel different. The Arduino library might have been worked with slower updates historically; your ESP32 setup might be pushing faster changes.

⸻

5. Specific code snippets — how mapping is done

Here are key snippets (from ESP32Servo; for Arduino we only have commentary but the mapping logic is essentially the same).

ESP32Servo write method (simplified)

void Servo::write(int value)
{
  int pulseWidth_us;
  if (value < MIN_PULSE_WIDTH) {
    // treat as microseconds
    pulseWidth_us = value;
  } else {
    // treat as degrees: 0-180 maps to min-max
    pulseWidth_us = map(value, 0, 180, min, max);
  }
  writeMicroseconds(pulseWidth_us);
}

void Servo::writeMicroseconds(int value_us)
{
  if (value_us < min) value_us = min;
  else if (value_us > max) value_us = max;

  // Convert to tick count for LEDC PWM
  ticks = (long)( (value_us) / (pulse_period_us / timer_width_ticks) );
  pwm.write(pinNumber, ticks);
}

(from GitHub source)  ￼

Arduino library mapping commentary

“The write method simply maps the degrees to microseconds and calls the writeMicroseconds method anyway.”  ￼
And:
“If you use write(angle) and you didn’t override the min/max, the default min and max are 544 and 2400 µs.”  ￼

So essentially: degrees → µs → hardware pulses.

⸻

6. What isn’t happening (in both libraries)
	•	Neither library by default does ramping interpolation (e.g., smoothly stepping from current angle to target over many small increments inside the driver). If you want ease-in/ease-out, you must implement that yourself (or use a library built for smoothing, e.g. ServoEasing).  ￼
	•	Neither library is aware of the physical speed or load of the servo; they just set the target pulse width immediately.

⸻

7. Recommendations (to make the ESP32 behaviour smoother)

Since you are seeing jerky/stepped motion with the same input sequence, here are steps to improve smoothness on the ESP32 using ESP32Servo (or even switching libraries):
	•	Ensure you are updating the servo angle slower, i.e., don’t call write() with large jumps in angle; instead increment the angle in small steps (e.g., 0.5° or 1° every X ms) so the servo has time to move.
	•	Insert a small delay between successive write() calls so you don’t overload the servo with too many updates too fast.
	•	If possible, increase the tick resolution (in ESP32Servo you might adjust timer_width) so that the PWM duty change granularity is finer; this can reduce visible steps.
	•	Explicitly specify min and max pulse widths in attach(pin, min_us, max_us) that match your servo’s actual spec (e.g., 1000-2000 µs) rather than defaults (544-2400 µs); this gives better mapping and may reduce unintended coarse jumps.
	•	If more advanced, implement interpolation in software: when you get a new target angle, compute small increments from current angle to target over time (e.g., every 10 ms) and call write() for each increment.
	•	Check hardware factors: power supply stability, servo mechanical play, PWM frequency (50 Hz is standard). Sometimes jerky motion is caused by power sag or mechanical stiction rather than library.
	•	Compare latency: maybe the ESP32 servo update has some lag or coarser hardware tick size causing visible steps.

⸻

8. Final diagnosis

In conclusion, the reason your Arduino version appears “perfectly smooth” while the ESP32Servo version shows “stepped/jerky” is most likely because:
	•	The Arduino library’s refresh/ISR mechanism and perhaps slower update rate mask the discrete jumps, making motion appear fluid.
	•	On the ESP32, the PWM hardware driver in ESP32Servo is doing exactly the same physical task (set duty for 50 Hz), but because you are perhaps updating more aggressively and the duty resolution is coarser (or your angle jumps are larger) the motion becomes visibly stepped.
	•	The lack of built-in interpolation means that when target positions change abruptly, the servo must physically traverse the jump; if you gave it more time and smaller increments, it would look smoother.

If you like, I can pull the full source code of the Arduino Servo.cpp (from AVR core) and of ESP32Servo side-by-side, highlight literal code differences (tick resolution, mapping constants, timer setup) so you can see the concrete difference at instruction level. Would you like me to fetch that?


### Step 2 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Analysis of GPT-5 Research on Servo Library Differences
**Action**: Reviewed comprehensive GPT-5 analysis comparing Arduino Servo.h vs ESP32Servo implementations.

**Result**: 
Key findings:
- **Both libraries use identical mapping logic** (degrees → microseconds → hardware pulses)
- **Neither library has built-in interpolation** - both rely on mechanical inertia for smoothness
- **Critical difference identified**: ESP32Servo uses LEDC hardware PWM with tick quantization
- **Root cause hypothesis**: ESP32Servo's tick resolution may be coarser, causing discrete jumps in duty cycle
- Arduino library defaults (544-2400µs) provide larger span = more µs per degree = smoother perceived motion
- ESP32Servo's `timer_width` parameter determines tick resolution granularity

**Notes**:
- The GPT-5 analysis suggests the issue is **not** in our interpolation logic (which is correct)
- The problem is likely in ESP32Servo's tick resolution quantization when converting microseconds to PWM ticks
- ESP32Servo's formula: `ticks = (value_us) / (pulse_period_us / timer_width_ticks)` introduces quantization
- With 16-bit timer_width (default), we get 65536 possible tick values for 0-20000µs period = ~0.3µs resolution
- However, if angle changes result in small tick increments, the servo sees discrete duty changes
- The stepping we observe is likely the servo responding to these quantized duty changes faster than mechanical inertia can smooth them

**Next Steps**: Experiment with ESP32Servo's timer_width parameter to increase tick resolution, or implement finer microsecond-level control by using writeMicroseconds() with sub-degree precision in smoothMove().

### Step 3 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Implemented Microsecond-Level Precision
**Action**: Modified smoothMove() to interpolate at microsecond level instead of degree level.

**Result**: 
- Mapped degrees to microseconds at start/target (1000-2000µs for 0-180 degrees)
- Interpolated pulse widths in microsecond increments
- Used servo.writeMicroseconds() directly instead of setPosition()
- Updated currentPosition tracking to match

**Notes**:
- Rationale: GPT-5 research identified quantization as root cause
- By interpolating at 1000µs-2000µs range instead of 0-180 degrees, we get 1000 discrete values vs 180
- This should reduce stepping by providing finer intermediate positions
- Timing unchanged: 20ms delays, linear interpolation
- Awaiting user testing to validate improvement

**Next Steps**: Test firmware and report if microsecond-level precision improves smoothness. If still stepped, investigate ESP32Servo's timer_width parameter for increasing PWM resolution.

### Step 4 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Microsecond Approach Failed - Analyzing Alternatives
**Action**: Tested microsecond-level precision approach.

**Result**: 
- Motion is WORSE - more stepped than before
- Servo opening wider than expected (positioning error)
- Approach rejected as ineffective

**Notes**:
- Microsecond interpolation did not solve the quantization issue
- The wider opening suggests mapping (1000-2000µs) may be incorrect for this servo
- Need to revert to working state and try different approaches

**Potential Approaches Based on GPT-5 Research:**

1. **Increase ESP32Servo tick resolution** - Modify timer_width parameter
   - ESP32 supports up to 20-bit timer width
   - Current default likely 16-bit (65536 ticks)
   - Increasing to 20-bit = 1,048,576 ticks for 20000µs period = 0.019µs resolution
   - **Pros**: Addresses root cause (quantization), library-level solution
   - **Cons**: Requires modifying ESP32Servo internals or finding configuration method

2. **Match Arduino defaults (544-2400µs)** - Use wider pulse width range
   - GPT-5 noted Arduino's default 544-2400µs gives more µs per degree
   - Current implementation likely uses 1000-2000µs (standard servo range)
   - **Pros**: Proven by Arduino's smooth behavior, simple change
   - **Cons**: May exceed servo's mechanical limits

3. **Reduce update frequency** - Call write() less frequently
   - Research suggests Arduino benefits from slower updates
   - Try 40ms or 50ms delays instead of 20ms
   - Give servo more time to physically respond between commands
   - **Pros**: Works with mechanical inertia, simple timing change
   - **Cons**: Slower motion, may not solve stepping if quantization is issue

4. **Implement proper easing with larger steps** - Reduce number of intermediate positions
   - Instead of updating every 20ms with 1° increments
   - Update every 50-100ms with 2-5° increments
   - Let mechanical inertia smooth between updates
   - **Pros**: Leverages servo's physical smoothing, reduces PWM updates
   - **Cons**: May appear choppier, defeats purpose of smooth motion

5. **Switch to Arduino Servo.h via Arduino IDE** - Use proven working library
   - TwoSkulls uses Arduino IDE with Servo.h
   - PlatformIO could potentially use same library
   - **Pros**: Guaranteed to work (proven by TwoSkulls)
   - **Cons**: Breaks PlatformIO workflow, requires Arduino IDE or complex library port

**Most Promising Approach**: 
**#1 - Increase ESP32Servo tick resolution** by configuring timer_width to 20-bit (maximum). This directly addresses GPT-5's root cause analysis (quantization) and should provide sufficient resolution to eliminate visible stepping while keeping our current PlatformIO setup.

**Next Steps**: Research how to configure ESP32Servo's timer_width parameter, or find alternative servo library with finer PWM resolution.

### Step 5 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Increased Timer Width to 20-Bit Resolution
**Action**: Added servo.setTimerWidth(20) call in initialize() function to maximize PWM resolution.

**Result**: 
- ESP32Servo supports setTimerWidth() method with range 10-20 bits
- Changed from default 10-bit (1024 ticks) to maximum 20-bit (1,048,576 ticks)
- Resolution improvement: 1024x finer PWM quantization
- With 20-bit timer: 1,048,576 ticks for 20000µs period = 0.019µs resolution
- Reverted smoothMove() to original linear interpolation (removed microsecond approach)

**Notes**:
- According to ESP32Servo source, must call setTimerWidth() BEFORE attach()
- 20-bit resolution should provide sufficient granularity to eliminate visible stepping
- This directly addresses GPT-5's identified root cause (PWM quantization)
- Simple one-line change: servo.setTimerWidth(20) before servo.attach()

**Next Steps**: Test firmware and report if 20-bit timer width eliminates stepping. If still present, investigate approach #2 (matching Arduino defaults) or #3 (slower update frequency).

### Step 6 (20250123-UNKNOWN): 20-Bit Timer Width Failed - Still Stepping
**Action**: Tested 20-bit timer width with maximum PWM resolution.

**Result**: 
- Stepping still present despite 1024x resolution increase
- Quantization is NOT the root cause
- Hypothesis from GPT-5 research: "if your update frequency (calls per second) is high, each increment may be just a few ticks, so the servo moves a little, waits until the next pulse, moves a little again — which looks like stepping"

**Key Insight**:
The GPT-5 research highlights: "ESP32Servo uses hardware PWM LEDC channels which continuously output the configured duty at the set frequency (50 Hz) without needing interrupts to start/stop each pulse. This is good in principle — less CPU overhead — but it does mean that... how frequently you call write() become more significant."

**Analysis**:
- Current: Updating every 20ms with small angle increments
- Servo physical response time may be slower than our 20ms update rate
- Result: Servo sees discrete position commands faster than it can respond mechanically
- This creates visible stepping as servo tries to "catch up" to rapid discrete commands

**Next Steps**: Implement slower update frequency (40-50ms delays) to give servo time to physically respond between commands, leveraging mechanical inertia as Arduino library does.

### Step 7 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Slower Update Rate Made Stepping Worse
**Action**: Changed delay from 20ms to 50ms to slow update rate.

**Result**: 
- Stepping is WORSE with slower updates
- This confirms we're on the wrong track
- The problem is not update frequency

**Critical Insight from GPT-5 Research**:
"The important difference: it uses the LEDC (ESP32 hardware PWM) API... which is not interrupt-driven in the same way as the AVR library, but uses hardware PWM channels... Each write() call effectively updates the duty (tick count) for the PWM channel... No built-in interpolation/ramping either; you set a target angle and the library translates that to the appropriate duty."

**Key Realization**:
- Arduino Servo.h: Timer-based ISR delivers pulses at fixed intervals, relies on mechanical inertia
- ESP32Servo: LEDC hardware PWM outputs continuous duty cycle, no built-in smoothing
- **We may be fighting the library's design** by trying to add software interpolation on top
- The servo is physically capable (TwoSkulls proves it) - the issue is how we're driving it

**Fundamental Question**: 
Are we over-engineering this? The GPT-5 research states "No built-in interpolation/ramping" for ESP32Servo - meaning we're implementing interpolation that the library doesn't support. Maybe we need to:
1. Stop trying to smooth in software
2. Let the servo respond naturally to direct position commands
3. Or find a way to use ESP32 LEDC features directly with interpolation/smoothing

**Next Steps**: Revert interpolation entirely, try setting target position directly and letting servo respond naturally. If that doesn't work, investigate using ESP32 LEDC API directly with ramp/duty curve features.

### Step 8 (20250123-UNKNOWN): Direct Position Setting Failed - Reverting to Best Working State
**Action**: Tried removing all interpolation, setting target position directly.

**Result**: 
- Way worse - jerking open and closed instantly
- Confirmed that interpolation IS necessary
- Need to revert to best-known working implementation

**Conclusion**: Best result was with 20ms delays and linear interpolation (before timer width changes). Reverting to that implementation.

**Next Steps**: Upload reverted code with 20ms delays, keep 20-bit timer width setting as it doesn't hurt. Accept that we may not achieve Arduino Servo.h levels of smoothness with ESP32Servo library due to fundamental architectural differences.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Accept current implementation as "best effort" with ESP32Servo
2. Consider alternative approach: Use Arduino IDE for servo control if smoothness is critical
3. Investigate alternative servo libraries that may provide better smoothing features
4. Consider hardware solutions: Different servo, servo controller board with built-in interpolation

## 20250127-NOW: Servo Wild Swinging During Initialization Exceeding Safe Limits

**Description:**  
The servo exhibits dangerous wild swinging behavior during system initialization, performing 3-4 large sweeps before coming to rest at an extreme angle that causes stalling. This occurs despite implementation of hard microsecond limits (1400-1600µs defaults, 900-2200µs from config) and use of writeMicroseconds() with constraint enforcement in setPosition().

**Environment:**  
- Platform: ESP32-WROVER on perfboard
- Framework: PlatformIO with Arduino framework
- Servo Library: ESP32Servo@3.0.9
- Servo: Hitec HS-125MG
- Config: SD card with servo_us_min=900, servo_us_max=2200

**Evidence:**
- Servo swings wildly 3-4 times during startup
- Movement exceeds safe limits (swings past expected 900-2200µs range)
- Ends at extreme angle causing mechanical stall
- Behavior occurs both with and without SD card present
- Hard limit enforcement code exists but not preventing the issue

**Recent Changes That May Be Related:**
- Modified setPosition() to use writeMicroseconds() with map(degrees, 0, 180, minUs, maxUs)
- Added minMicroseconds/maxMicroseconds class members for hard limits
- Implemented constrain() enforcement before writeMicroseconds()
- Changed from servo.write(degrees) to servo.writeMicroseconds(microseconds)
- User corrected mapping from map(degrees, minDegrees-maxDegrees, ...) to map(degrees, 0-180, ...)

### Step 1 (20250127-1430): Initial Problem Documentation
**Action**: Documented wild swinging issue and reviewed recent code changes.

**Result**: 
Identified potential issue areas:
- Initialization sequence calls setPosition() multiple times (min→max→min positions)
- Animation runs BEFORE config loads, uses safe defaults (1400-1600µs)
- Re-attach animation runs AFTER config loads (900-2200µs)
- May be race condition or incorrect limit application during init
- User corrected mapping formula from map(degrees, minDeg-maxDeg, ...) to map(degrees, 0-180, ...)

**Notes**:
- Current initialization flow:
  1. servoController.initialize() called before SD card loads
  2. Attaches with safe defaults (1400-1600µs)
  3. Runs init animation: setPosition(minDegrees=0) → setPosition(maxDegrees=80) → setPosition(minDegrees=0)
  4. Config loads from SD card
  5. reattachWithConfigLimits() called (if config loads)
  6. Runs config animation: setPosition(maxDegrees=80) → setPosition(minDegrees=0) → setPosition(0)
- Each setPosition() maps degrees to microseconds, but if mapping is wrong or limits aren't enforced properly, servo could exceed bounds
- The "wild swinging" suggests servo is receiving microseconds values outside 900-2200µs range
- Could be: incorrect map() calculation, limits not initialized properly, or servo.writeMicroseconds() being called with unconstrained values

**Next Steps**: Add debug logging to setPosition() to print calculated microseconds values and verify constrain() is working. Check if minMicroseconds/maxMicroseconds are properly initialized before first use.

### Step 2 (20251027-0945): Re-read context and enumerate servo touch points
**Action**: Reviewed README, issue log, and all servo-related source files (`src/servo_controller.*`, `src/main.cpp`, `src/skull_audio_animator.cpp`, `src/servo_tester.*`). Cross-referenced with TwoSkulls implementation for deltas.  
**Result**: Confirmed initialization order (eyes → servo → SD/config) and identified jaw movement entry points (init animation, breathing cycle, audio RMS mapping). Noted that `setPosition()` currently maps `0-180` degrees to the configured µs range, even though jaw is clamped to `0-80` degrees. Logged that `LightController::begin()` runs before servo attach and uses LEDC PWM channels 0/1 at 5 kHz.  
**Notes**: Stepping issue remains documented separately; current focus is wild swinging during startup.

### Step 3 (20251027-1030): Inspect ESP32Servo internals & LEDC usage
**Action**: Read `.pio/libdeps/esp32dev/ESP32Servo/src/ESP32Servo.cpp` and `ESP32PWM.cpp` to understand attach semantics, timer/channel allocation, and frequency handling.  
**Result**: Learned that `servo.attach()` defaults to the lowest available LEDC channel, sharing timers within LEDC groups. Frequency changes on one channel propagate to others sharing the timer. Library expects exclusive control of whichever channel/timer it grabs at attach time.  
**Notes**: Because we never call `ESP32PWM::allocateTimer()`, channel assignment is opportunistic and can collide with other LEDC clients.

### Step 4 (20251027-1115): Trace eye LED PWM behaviour
**Action**: Inspected `src/light_controller.*` to understand when and how LED PWM is configured.  
**Result**: Eyes attach to LEDC channels 0 and 1 at 5 kHz during startup and reattach whenever brightness drops below full. This happens before or during servo initialization, so eye PWM likely claims the same LEDC timer the servo needs.  
**Notes**: Reattachment occurs in `setEyeBrightness()` even after the servo has begun its init animation, which explains intermittent channel stealing.

### Step 5 (20251027-1200): Hypothesis on root cause
**Action**: Combined findings from Steps 2–4 to evaluate why hard µs limits fail.  
**Result**: Concluded the wild swings stem from LEDC timer/channel contention: LightController reattaches to LEDC channel 0 at 5 kHz, forcing the servo’s hardware timer away from 50 Hz mid-animation. That invalidates the commanded pulse widths, producing large, uncontrolled sweeps despite software constraints.  
**Notes**: Mapping issue in `setPosition()` (80° → ~1480 µs) reduces jaw travel but is secondary; primary fault is hardware PWM conflict.

### Step 6 (20251027-1245): Document mitigation plan
**Action**: Outlined fixes to resolve channel contention and restore predictable servo control.  
**Result**: Proposed reserving a dedicated LEDC timer/channel for the servo (e.g., via `ESP32PWM::allocateTimer()` or manual `ledcAttachChannel` with unique group), deferring eye PWM until after servo init, and correcting degree→µs mapping once hardware conflict is eliminated.  
**Notes**: Next implementation task: modify initialization order and LEDC assignments, then retest startup sequence to confirm servo stabilizes.

### Step 7 (20251027-1305): Prepare implementation work
**Action**: Planned code changes to isolate jaw servo from eye PWM, including updating LED channel assignments, reserving a servo-only LEDC timer before attach, and fixing the degree→µs mapping. Scheduled to log progress throughout implementation.  
**Result**: Ready to modify `src/light_controller.*`, `src/servo_controller.cpp`, and any supporting headers while keeping TwoSkulls untouched.  
**Notes**: Will ensure eyes remain functional at 5 kHz and servo retains 50 Hz without channel contention.

### Step 8 (20251027-1315): Move eye PWM to dedicated channels
**Action**: Updated `src/light_controller.h` to use LEDC channels 4 and 5 (timer 2) instead of 0 and 1, so eye PWM no longer competes for the lowest channels.  
**Result**: Eyes now occupy a separate timer group at 5 kHz, clearing the original channel that ESP32Servo tended to claim.  
**Notes**: LightController logic still reattaches PWM when dimming, but it now manipulates timer 2 exclusively, leaving timer 3 free for the servo.

### Step 9 (20251027-1330): Reserve servo timer and fix degree mapping
**Action**: Included `ESP32PWM.h` in `src/servo_controller.cpp`, reserved LEDC timer 3 before every attach, and added safeguards so the jaw maps its configured degree range to the configured µs range (with a guard for zero-width ranges).  
**Result**: Servo attaches to a dedicated timer regardless of reattaches, eliminating cross-frequency interference. Degree mapping now respects the 0–80° jaw clamp while still honoring configured microsecond limits.  
**Notes**: Next step is to validate behavior and ensure reattach path preserves exclusivity.

### Step 10 (20251027-1345): Build verification
**Action**: Ran `pio run` to ensure the project compiles after the LEDC and mapping changes.  
**Result**: `esp32dev` environment built successfully; `esp32dev_ota` emitted the expected warning about missing `upload_port` but still compiled. No compile-time regressions detected.  
**Notes**: Ready for on-hardware validation once OTA upload parameters are provided.

### Step 11 (20251027-1415): Hardware retest without SD card
**Action**: Tested latest firmware on hardware with SD card removed (config not loaded). Observed servo behavior during initial animation.  
**Result**: Servo still swings wildly back and forth after initialization logs, despite LEDC channel isolation and mapping fix. Serial output shows only the initial animation messages (0° → 80° → 0°).  
**Notes**: Confirms the previous fix is insufficient. Need deeper investigation—focus on actual PWM frequency/channel assignment and fallback configuration when SD is absent.

### Step 12 (20251027-1445): Add instrumentation for servo PWM state
**Action**: Modified `src/servo_controller.cpp` to explicitly set the servo PWM refresh rate to 50 Hz after each attach and log the LEDC channel, measured frequency, timer width, and µs mapping whenever the servo initializes or reattaches. Added debug output showing the microsecond value for every `setPosition()` call.  
**Result**: Builds will now reveal which LEDC channel/timer the servo uses on hardware, and whether the commanded microsecond values stay within the expected limits during the problematic startup sequence.  
**Notes**: Next hardware test should capture the new logs to confirm the PWM configuration in the SD-missing scenario.

### Step 13 (20251027-1505): Instrumented boot test (no SD card)
**Action**: Ran the newly instrumented firmware without an SD card to capture servo PWM telemetry during the failure case.  
**Result**: Logs show the servo attaching to LEDC channel 6 with reported frequency 0 Hz and timer width 10 bits—indicating our 50 Hz/16-bit configuration is not sticking. `setPosition()` remains in the 1400-1600 µs window, yet the physical servo still oscillates violently.  
**Notes**: Need to revisit initialization order: call `setPeriodHertz(50)` and `setTimerWidth(16)` before `attach()`, and verify LEDC frequency afterwards. Also consider that the servo defaults (1400-1600 µs) may be too narrow for mechanical stability once PWM is fixed.

### Step 14 (20251027-1525): Verify PWM reconfiguration attempt
**Action**: Rebuilt firmware with `setPeriodHertz(50)`/`setTimerWidth(16)` calls moved ahead of `servo.attach()` and retested without the SD card.  
**Result**: Hardware log still reports `channel=6 freq=0.00Hz width=10 bits`, showing that ESP32Servo continues to revert to 10-bit/undefined frequency after attach. The servo keeps swinging wildly.  
**Notes**: Next mitigation: manually force LEDC configuration via `ledcSetup()`/`ledcAttachPin()` after attach to override the library defaults, then monitor the reported frequency again.

### Step 15 (20251027-1535): Force LEDC timer after attach
**Action**: Added explicit `ledcSetup(channel, 50, 16)` and `ledcAttachPin(pin, channel)` calls immediately after `servo.attach()` (and on reattach), plus a dummy `ledcWrite()` sync.  
**Result**: Firmware builds successfully; ready for another SD-less hardware test to check whether the logged frequency now reports 50 Hz and whether the servo stabilizes.  
**Notes**: Awaiting updated serial log to confirm the override took effect; if freq still reads 0 Hz, consider replacing ESP32Servo with direct LEDC control.

### Step 16 (20251027-1600): Hardware validation & adjust defaults
**Action**: Tested the latest build without an SD card; servo now moves smoothly and no longer swings wildly, but the power-on sweep spans the full 900-2200 µs range and stalls at mechanical limits. Restored the narrow 1400-1600 µs defaults in `ConfigManager` so the initial animation remains gentle unless the SD config expands the range.  
**Result**: Servo initialization is stable and limited to the safe span when SD is absent; wider motion still available via SD configuration once loaded.  
**Notes**: Next step is to confirm on-device that the reduced defaults keep the opening movement modest while preserving stability.

### Step 17 (20251027-1700): Replace ESP32Servo with direct LEDC control
**Action**: Reimplemented `ServoController` using native LEDC APIs (50 Hz, 15-bit resolution) to eliminate ESP32Servo’s timer resets. Added dedicated `writeMicroseconds()` that computes duty cycles directly and keeps absolute safety bounds (500-2500 µs).  
**Result**: Build succeeds; ready to validate on hardware that the jaw remains stable across reboots without relying on ESP32Servo internals.  
**Notes**: Expecting `I/Servo` logs to show the configured LEDC frequency/resolution once flashed.

### Step 18 (20251027-1725): Regression observed after LEDC rewrite
**Action**: Flashed LEDC-only build without SD card; servo still swings wildly even though logs show `freq=50.00Hz` and µs values remain 1400-1600. Requested deeper research into historical behavior and alternative libraries.  
**Result**: Issue persists despite direct LEDC control, indicating a deeper problem with our duty calculations or hardware assumptions.  
**Notes**: Next steps: review project history for library changes, then research recommended ESP32 servo control libraries/settings.

### Step 19 (20251027-1745): Restore ESP32Servo usage (`servo.write`)
**Action**: Reverted `ServoController` to the simpler ESP32Servo-based implementation (attach with current µs limits and use `servo.write` for degrees) mirroring the original working code path. Removed direct LEDC manipulation while keeping config-driven reattach logic.  
**Result**: Firmware builds successfully; ready to validate hardware behavior with the leaner implementation before considering alternative libraries (e.g., ServoESP32/MCPWM).  
**Notes**: If wild swinging persists, escalate to ServoESP32 (MCPWM-backed) as the next experiment.

### Step 20 (20251027-1815): Switch to ServoESP32 (MCPWM-backed) library
**Action**: Replaced ESP32Servo dependency with RoboticsBrno's ServoESP32 (v1.1.1), updated build to C++17, and adapted `ServoController`/`ServoTester` to use the new `Servo::attach(pin, channel, ..., min_us, max_us, 50Hz)` signature.  
**Result**: Project builds cleanly with ServoESP32; ready for on-device validation to see if MCPWM driver resolves the runaway startup issue.  
**Notes**: If hardware still misbehaves, investigate pin conflicts or fall back to Espressif's official MCPWM servo component.

### Step 21 (20251027-1905): Hardware-specific runaway confirmed
**Action**: Flashed the simplified tester build (`SERVO_TEST_MODE=true`) and powered the skull with three different servos in succession. Two alternate servos (generic micro and Tower Pro SG90) behaved perfectly—startup wiggle stayed within ±100 µs and repeated sweeps were stable. Reinstalled the project’s HS-125MG and it immediately resumed the wild full-span sweep across several plug/unplug cycles before spontaneously returning to normal behavior on the fifth power cycle.  
**Result**: Runaway motion reproduces only with the HS-125MG unit and only intermittently; same firmware and wiring remain stable on other servos.  
**Notes**: Likely points to the HS-125MG’s internal controller entering a bad state (possible pot jitter or MCU reset glitch) when it sees the initial 1500 µs pulse during brown-out. Recommend: 1) capture supply voltage during power-on, 2) add inline series resistor or ferrite to dampen noise, 3) try powering servo from bench supply to rule out PSU sag, 4) consider replacing the servo if the fault recurs.

### Step 7 (20250127-1600): Verified Analysis and Findings Review
**Action**: Reviewed Steps 2-6 analysis against ESP32 LEDC documentation and current codebase implementation.

**Result**: 
Confirmed validity of both identified issues:

**1. Mapping Bug (Step 5) - CONFIRMED CRITICAL:**
- Current: `map(degrees, 0, 180, minUs, maxUs)` when servo range is 0-80°
- Impact: 80° maps to ~44% of µs range instead of 100%, severely limiting travel
- Example: With 900-2200µs range, 80° → ~1480µs (should be 2200µs)
- Fix: Change to `map(degrees, minDegrees, maxDegrees, minUs, maxUs)`

**2. LEDC Timer Contention (Steps 3-6) - PLAUSIBLE, needs verification:**
- ESP32 LEDC: 4 timers (0-3), channels share timers, frequency changes affect all channels on same timer
- LightController: Uses `ledcSetup()` for channels 0-1 at 5kHz, reattaches during init
- ESP32Servo: Uses `pwm.setup()` which claims lowest available channel/timer  
- Risk: If servo and eyes share a timer, eye reattach at 5kHz could disrupt servo's 50Hz signal
- "Works on first boot only" behavior strongly suggests hardware state/timer allocation issue

**Assessment:**
Both issues are valid. Mapping bug is definite and will cause incorrect positioning. LEDC contention is likely contributing factor but needs verification.

**Fix Priority:**
1. Fix mapping bug first (simpler, definite issue)
2. Test if wild swinging persists  
3. If persists, implement LEDC timer isolation via `ESP32PWM::allocateTimer()` or reorder initialization

**Next Steps**: Fix mapping bug first: change `setPosition()` to use `map(degrees, minDegrees, maxDegrees, minUs, maxUs)`. Test. If wild swinging persists, implement LEDC timer isolation.
