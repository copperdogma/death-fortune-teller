# Perfboard Assembly Conversation

20251029: Between me and GPT5 Thinking (via codex)

** This one was to consolidate all others and do the final documentation updates and perfboard-assembly.md document.

----

Read README.md docs/spec.md and docs/hardware.md for context. Your job is going to be to update the docs/hardware.md doc to the final decisions and
  then produce a build guide for me to use when actually soldering all of this up on a perfboard for the final build.

  This doc has already been talked about between me and some AIs. You will have four jobs:

  1) Read the context I gave you above and then the conversation docs: ai-work/perfboard-assembly-convo-gpt5-main.md ai-work/perfboard-assembly-convo-
  gemini.md ai-work/perfboard-assembly-convo-grok.md ai-work/perfboard-assembly-convo-claude-opus.md
  2) Pause and ask any questions you have for clarification, preferences, etc. Most of them may already be answered by the other AIs from the previous
  docs
  3) Update the docs/hardware.md doc with any final changes to the plans/decisions or corrections. There were a couple but not many.
  4) Create the definitive new Perfboard Assembly document in /docs as perfboard-assembly.md in markdown

  Feel free to search as far and wide in this project as you like for more context.

• Here are my clarifying questions before I lock the hardware doc and write the perfboard build guide.

  Power and protection

  - Confirm final input: 2.1 mm panel‑mount barrel jack, center‑positive, fed by a 5 V 5 A adapter, correct?
  - Back‑feed protection: do you want the Schottky diode in series at the main 5 V input (simplest; 0.2–0.4 V drop seen by everything) or only on the
    ESP32‑WROVER VIN branch (keeps printer/servo at full 5 V)? Parts on hand: 1N5822 (min) / SR560 (preferred ≥5 A)?
  - Acceptable voltage drop for loads: OK if printer/servo see ~4.6–4.8 V under load (with series Schottky), or should I keep them at a full 5.0 V and
    diode only the WROVER branch?

  Powering the ESP32‑C3

  - Do you want the C3 powered from the WROVER’s 3.3 V pin (adds ~100 mA to WROVER’s reg) or from the 5 V rail into the C3’s onboard regulator? I can
    document either; default recommendation is 5 V→C3 VIN unless you prefer the shared 3.3 V rail.

  SD card and GPIO4

  - Final decision is SD_MMC forced to 1‑bit mode at 20 MHz, and the capacitive sensor on GPIO 4. OK to explicitly note “D1/D2 are unused in 1‑bit, so
    GPIO4 is conflict‑free”?

  LEDs, resistors, connector

  - Two LEDs total (1 eye on GPIO32, 1 mouth on GPIO33) with 100 Ω series resistors. Do you want me to standardize on a single 3‑pin connector for both
    LEDs (as in docs/hardware-led_cluster_wiring_diagram.md), pin order: Eye, Mouth, GND?

  Long printer cable

  - 4 ft run to printer over 9600 baud: proceed with twisted pairs from Ethernet cable? I’ll pair TX with GND and RX with GND, and call that out
    explicitly unless you prefer shielded cable.

  Servo branch decoupling

  - OK to add a dedicated 470–1000 µF electrolytic on the servo 5 V branch in addition to 1000–2200 µF on the printer branch?

  Wire gauges and color key

  - Confirm: 18–20 AWG for barrel jack to board and ground bus; 20–22 AWG for 5 V branches; signal wires 24–26 AWG. Color key: red=5 V, black=GND,
    green=TX out of a device, yellow=RX into a device, purple=LED signals, white=cap sense. Any changes?

  Skull switch header

  - Keep a 2‑pin inline header on the 5 V high side for the skull’s built‑in switch, jumpered closed for now?

  If you confirm the above (especially diode placement and C3 power choice), I’ll:

  - Update docs/hardware.md to reflect the final decisions and clean up minor inconsistencies.
  - Add the definitive docs/perfboard-assembly.md with step‑by‑step layout, wiring order, test checkpoints, and color‑coded mapping.


› Power and protection

    - Confirm final input: 2.1 mm panel‑mount barrel jack, center‑positive, fed by a 5 V 5 A adapter, correct?
      >> YES

    - Back‑feed protection: do you want the Schottky diode in series at the main 5 V input (simplest; 0.2–0.4 V drop seen by everything) or only on the
  ESP32‑WROVER VIN branch (keeps printer/servo at full 5 V)? Parts on hand: 1N5822 (min) / SR560 (preferred ≥5 A)?
      >> All I care about for diodes is protecting my computer from power backfeed.

    - Acceptable voltage drop for loads: OK if printer/servo see ~4.6–4.8 V under load (with series Schottky), or should I keep them at a full 5.0 V and
  diode only the WROVER branch?
      >> HALT: Break down what both scenarios would look like from a build perspective.

    Powering the ESP32‑C3

    - Do you want the C3 powered from the WROVER’s 3.3 V pin (adds ~100 mA to WROVER’s reg) or from the 5 V rail into the C3’s onboard regulator? I can
  document either; default recommendation is 5 V→C3 VIN unless you prefer the shared 3.3 V rail.
      >> Power it from the WROVER. It draws VERY little power and it's more power efficient to give it 3.3v instead of 5v and let it waste the rest.

    SD card and GPIO4

    - Final decision is SD_MMC forced to 1‑bit mode at 20 MHz, and the capacitive sensor on GPIO 4. OK to explicitly note “D1/D2 are unused in 1‑bit, so
  GPIO4 is conflict‑free”?
      >> HALT: Research this. What are our options?

    LEDs, resistors, connector

    - Two LEDs total (1 eye on GPIO32, 1 mouth on GPIO33) with 100 Ω series resistors. Do you want me to standardize on a single 3‑pin connector for both
  LEDs (as in docs/hardware-led_cluster_wiring_diagram.md), pin order: Eye, Mouth, GND?
      >> YES

    Long printer cable

    - 4 ft run to printer over 9600 baud: proceed with twisted pairs from Ethernet cable? I’ll pair TX with GND and RX with GND, and call that out
      explicitly unless you prefer shielded cable.
        >> YES. ethernet. Easy to swap out if there are issues. Note that it's not an ethernet JACK, just the cable type

    Servo branch decoupling

    - OK to add a dedicated 470–1000 µF electrolytic on the servo 5 V branch in addition to 1000–2200 µF on the printer branch?
    >> SURE

    Wire gauges and color key

    - Confirm: 18–20 AWG for barrel jack to board and ground bus; 20–22 AWG for 5 V branches; signal wires 24–26 AWG. Color key: red=5 V, black=GND,
      green=TX out of a device, yellow=RX into a device, purple=LED signals, white=cap sense. Any changes?
      >> orange = 3.3v, otherwise great

    Skull switch header

    - Keep a 2‑pin inline header on the 5 V high side for the skull’s built‑in switch, jumpered closed for now?
      >> Nah, drop it. Now that we're using a barrel jack I don't think the skull's built-in power switch could handle the amps.
