"Home Accents Holiday 5 ft LED ULTRA Pose-N-Stay Skeleton"

Bought from Home Depot: https://www.homedepot.ca/product/home-accents-holiday-5-ft-led-ultra-pose-n-stay-skeleton/1001906564

This one's great because it already has 3 LEDs (2x eyes, 1x mouth), 3xAA battery pack, and a switch (I didn't use those two, but we could!).

Ideally I'd be able to buy JUST the head. The one I got was great but came with a whole skeleton. I don't want buy it and throw away the skeleton. Although we COULD find uses for the skeleton. And we could just retrofit Jeff/Anthony old head to a skeleton body to use a a prop/in the car/for something simple. Or just disassemble the skeleton and use it as bones, or the ribcage as a xlyophone or something.
