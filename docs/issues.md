### 001: Servo Stepping Motion
**Status**: Known Limitation  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Breathing cycle servo motion exhibits visible stepping/jerky motion when using ESP32Servo library, while the TwoSkulls reference implementation (Arduino Servo.h) produces perfectly smooth motion.  
**Details**: See [servo-issues.md](../ai-work/issues/servo-issues.md) for complete investigation log.
