# OTA (Over-the-Air) Workflow

## Overview
- Wireless firmware updates use PlatformIO‚Äôs `esp32dev_ota` environment and ArduinoOTA.
- Log access is provided over Telnet (port 23) with the centralized `LoggingManager`.
- OTA automatically pauses audio playback and Bluetooth retries; both resume after the update finishes or aborts.

## Requirements
- Device must be powered on and connected to your network. If you are unsure, verify via USB console first or ensure the ESP32 has booted into OTA mode before triggering uploads.
- SD card `/config/config.txt` must contain:
  ```ini
  wifi_ssid=YourNetwork
  wifi_password=YourPassword
  ota_hostname=death-fortune-teller
  ota_password=YourSecurePassword
  bluetooth_enabled=true
  ```
- On your development machine:
  1. Create `platformio.local.ini` in the project root (git-ignored):
     ```ini
     [env:esp32dev_ota]
     upload_flags =
         --auth=${sysenv.ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD}
     ```
  2. Export `ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD` (or replace the placeholder with your password):
     ```bash
     export ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword
     ```
- Optional: set `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` if the device IP changes (defaults to `192.168.86.29`).

### Quick manual OTA checklist (recommended)
1. **Discover the skull**  
   ```bash
   python scripts/discover_esp32.py
   export DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=<ip-from-output>
   ```
   The discovery script now verifies the RemoteDebug banner / OTA port so it only reports the actual skull as ‚ÄúActive‚Äù.
2. **(Optional) Verify signal + heap**  
   If USB is connected, check the serial heartbeat for `RSSI` and free heap. RSSI stronger than ‚àí70‚ÄØdBm yields the most reliable OTA sessions. When the link is weak, temporarily disabling Bluetooth (`-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` build flag or `bluetooth_enabled=false` in `config.txt`) reduces RF contention before running back-to-back OTAs.
3. **Kick off OTA**  
   ```bash
   pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload
   ```
   PlatformIO pulls `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` directly; no file edits required.

### About the auto-discovery upload task
- `python scripts/ota_upload_auto.py` / `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto` remain available, but they now leave `platformio.ini` untouched and simply export `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` for the upload process. Treat the feature as experimental until we get broader coverage.
- If the helper fails, fall back to the manual checklist above‚Äîno cleanup needed.
- When a USB console is available, you can still double-check the boot log: `WiFiManager: IP address: ... (RSSI: ... dBm)` is the authoritative address.

### During OTA the app loop idles automatically
- The firmware now halts its normal loop while an OTA is in progress‚Äîonly Wi-Fi/ArduinoOTA handlers continue running. The Bluetooth controller is explicitly powered down before flashing and brought back online afterward, so expect regular status logs while audio, sensors, and Bluetooth sleep until the transfer completes. Bluetooth restarts automatically ~8‚ÄØs after the OTA finishes to leave a window for back-to-back uploads.

### Disable Bluetooth when focusing on OTA stability (optional)
- The runtime OTA guard already pauses playback and shuts Bluetooth down, but if you want to keep the skull silent between repeated OTA sessions you can still set `bluetooth_enabled=false` in `config/config.txt` and reboot. The firmware will skip A2DP initialization entirely while the rest of the system stays online.
- For a quick compile-time kill switch you can also add `-DDISABLE_BLUETOOTH` to the relevant `build_flags`; both knobs accomplish the same thing.
- Re-enable Bluetooth (config and/or build flag) once OTA transfers are healthy again and you‚Äôre ready to exercise audio playback.

## Building & Uploading OTA

### OTA commands at a glance
- **Manual (preferred)**  
  ```bash
  pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload
  ```
- **Auto (experimental)**  
  ```bash
  python scripts/ota_upload_auto.py
  # or
  pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto
  ```
  That script now performs discovery, exports `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` for the child process, and skips permanent config edits. If it errors, run the manual command with the discovered IP.

### Troubleshooting toolkit
If OTA stalls, work through the helpers in this order:
```bash
python scripts/discover_esp32.py        # find the skull & check telnet/OTA status
python scripts/system_status.py         # summary of Wi-Fi, OTA, SD, audio
python scripts/telnet_command.py status --auto-discover
python scripts/troubleshoot.py          # guided checklist if things still fail
```

Key scripts (all under `scripts/`):
- `discover_esp32.py` ‚Äì scans the subnet, highlights the active skull, and reports telnet/OTA readiness.
- `system_status.py` ‚Äì auto-discovers the skull and prints a concise health report (Wi‚ÄëFi, OTA, telnet, SD, audio).
- `troubleshoot.py` ‚Äì interactive flow that walks through power, SD, Wi‚ÄëFi, and telnet checks.
- `telnet_command.py` ‚Äì one-shot telnet commands with auto-discovery (`--auto-discover`), password support, and better error reporting.

PlatformIO surfaces these tools as custom targets (`esp32dev_ota ‚Üí Discover ESP32`, `‚Üí System Status`, `‚Üí Troubleshoot`) and VS Code tasks mirror them under ‚ÄúDeath OTA‚Äù.

### Common issues & fixes
- **No active ESP32 found**: ensure the skull is powered, Wi‚ÄëFi credentials are correct, SD card is inserted, and give it 30‚Äì60‚ÄØs after boot. Re-run discovery or power cycle if needed.
- **Telnet connection timeout**: the telnet server may be paused or the device is in an error state. Try power cycling, verify Wi‚ÄëFi strength, and check the USB serial log if available.
- **OTA invite/transfer failures**: double-check Wi‚ÄëFi RSSI (< ‚àí70‚ÄØdBm is ideal), confirm telnet/OTA service is running, and consider temporarily disabling Bluetooth (config flag or telnet command) to reduce traffic before the upload.

### Helpful environment variables
Set these once per shell session to avoid retyping:
```bash
export DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.49
export ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword
```
`DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` is consumed automatically by the OTA scripts/tasks, and `ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD` feeds the `platformio.local.ini` template.

### Preventative tips
1. Reserve stable DHCP leases for each skull.
2. Keep per-skull `config.txt` files in sync (Wi‚ÄëFi / OTA settings).
3. Run `discover_esp32.py` before every session to spot IP drift early.
4. Maintain a quick reference of hostnames/IPs for manual overrides.
5. Use the environment variables above so scripts and tasks stay consistent.

## Telnet Logging & Commands
- Telnet address defaults to `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST:23`.
- Manual session:
  ```bash
  telnet <device-ip> 23
  ```
  Available commands: `status`, `wifi`, `ota`, `log`, `startup`, `head N`, `tail N`, `stream on|off`, `bluetooth on|off|status`, `reboot`, `help`.
  - Use Bluetooth control to silence the radio before OTA, and `reboot` for a remote restart when needed.
- Helper scripts:
  - `python scripts/telnet_command.py status`
  - `python scripts/telnet_command.py log`
  - `python scripts/telnet_stream.py`
  - Use `--strict` to fail on connection issues; otherwise scripts retry three times and exit 0 so tasks stay green.
- Tips:
  - Telnet streaming starts **off by default**; enable it explicitly with `python scripts/telnet_command.py stream on` and turn it back off with `stream off` when finished.
  - On marginal Wi-Fi links, pass shorter waits (for example `--read-timeout 1 --post-send-wait 1`) to `telnet_command.py` for quick status/log commands.
  - When toggling Bluetooth, allow more time (e.g. `--post-send-wait 3`) for the radio to shut down cleanly before OTA.
- PlatformIO custom targets (under `esp32dev_ota`):
  - `Telnet Status`, `Telnet Log`, `Telnet Startup`, `Telnet Head`, `Telnet Tail`, `Telnet Help`, `Telnet Stream`.
- VS Code tasks mirror the same commands (`Death OTA: Telnet Status`, etc.).
- `Discover ESP32` uses the cached IP for a quick check; run `Discover ESP32 (Full)` if you need a complete subnet scan.

### PlatformIO tasks
- **OTA Upload** wraps `scripts/ota_upload_auto.py`, which auto-discovers (or reuses the cached) IP, pauses Bluetooth, performs the upload, and restores Bluetooth‚Äîno manual `DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST` export required.
- Telnet and discovery tasks use the same cache (`.pio/death_fortune_host`). Each helper now attempts the cached/existing host first, only running fast discovery on failure, and exposes a `--full-discovery` flag when you explicitly want the slower subnet scan.

## Flash + Monitor Helpers
- USB (serial capture):
  ```bash
  python scripts/flash_and_monitor.py --mode usb --seconds 30
  ```
  - Available as `Flash + Monitor (USB)` under the `esp32dev` Project Tasks group or `Death USB: Flash + Monitor` from VS Code‚Äôs task menu.
- OTA (telnet capture):
  ```bash
  python scripts/flash_and_monitor.py --mode ota --capture telnet --seconds 30 --delay-after-flash 8
  ```
  - Surfaced via `Flash + Monitor (OTA)` in Project Tasks / `Death OTA: Flash + Monitor` in VS Code.
  - After the OTA upload completes the script waits a few seconds for the board to reboot, then collects telnet logs. If the board is offline, it exits successfully but prints the connection warning.

## Runtime Behavior
- OTA start: logs `‚è∏Ô∏è OTA start: pausing peripherals`, mutes audio, stops Bluetooth retries.
- OTA finish: logs `‚ñ∂Ô∏è OTA completed: resuming peripherals`, restores audio/Bluetooth.
- OTA auth failure: logs `üîê Authentication failed ‚Äì ensure host upload password matches ota_password on SD`.
- OTA receive failure: logs `üì∂ Receive failure ‚Äì check Wi-Fi signal quality and minimize peripheral activity during OTA`.

## Managing Multiple Skulls

When you have multiple Death Fortune Tellers powered up simultaneously, each needs to be uniquely identified to avoid conflicts during OTA updates.

### The Problem
- All skulls with identical `config.txt` settings will advertise the same OTA hostname
- Multiple devices responding to the same OTA name causes race conditions
- No way to distinguish which skull you're targeting for updates

### Solution: Unique Configuration Per Skull

**1. Give each skull its own identity:**
```ini
# Skull 1 config.txt
wifi_ssid=YourNetwork
wifi_password=YourPassword
ota_hostname=death-skull-1
ota_password=YourSecurePassword

# Skull 2 config.txt  
wifi_ssid=YourNetwork
wifi_password=YourPassword
ota_hostname=death-skull-2
ota_password=YourSecurePassword

# Skull 3 config.txt
wifi_ssid=YourNetwork
wifi_password=YourPassword
ota_hostname=death-skull-3
ota_password=YourSecurePassword
```

**2. Set target hostname before OTA operations:**
```bash
# Target specific skull
export DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.30  # Skull 1 IP
pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload

# Or use script overrides
python scripts/telnet_command.py status --host 192.168.86.31  # Skull 2
```

**3. Optional: Create separate PlatformIO environments**
```ini
# platformio.local.ini
[env:esp32dev_ota_skull1]
upload_flags = --auth=${sysenv.ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD}
upload_port = 192.168.86.30

[env:esp32dev_ota_skull2]  
upload_flags = --auth=${sysenv.ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD}
upload_port = 192.168.86.31

[env:esp32dev_ota_skull3]
upload_flags = --auth=${sysenv.ESP32_OTA_PASSWORD}
upload_port = 192.168.86.32
```

**4. Discovery and verification:**
```bash
# Check which skulls are online
python scripts/telnet_command.py status --host 192.168.86.30
python scripts/telnet_command.py status --host 192.168.86.31  
python scripts/telnet_command.py status --host 192.168.86.32

# Verify you're targeting the right skull
telnet 192.168.86.30 23
# Then run: status
```

### Best Practices
- Use static IPs or DHCP reservations for consistent addressing
- Keep a reference list of skull hostnames and IPs
- Always verify target skull before OTA operations
- Consider using mDNS discovery for automatic skull detection

## NEW: Auto-Discovery Debugging Tools

pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t troubleshoot
pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "No ESP32 found" or "Could not auto-discover"
**Symptoms**: Discovery script finds no active ESP32 devices
**Solutions**:
1. Check ESP32 is powered on and connected to WiFi
2. Verify SD card is inserted with proper config
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for ESP32 to fully boot
4. Power cycle the ESP32 if needed

#### Issue: "Telnet connection timeout" or "Connection closed"
**Symptoms**: ESP32 is reachable but telnet connections fail
**Solutions**:
1. ESP32 may be in error state - power cycle required
2. Check if telnet server is running on ESP32
3. Verify WiFi connection is stable
4. Check for error messages in ESP32 logs

#### Issue: "OTA upload fails" or "No response from ESP"
**Symptoms**: OTA upload attempts fail with timeout
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure ESP32 is connected to WiFi
2. Check OTA server is running (telnet should work)
3. Verify OTA password is correct
4. Power cycle ESP32 if in error state

### Environment Variables

Set these to avoid typing IP addresses:

```bash
# Set default ESP32 IP
export DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST=192.168.86.46

# Now you can use:
python scripts/telnet_command.py status
python scripts/telnet_command.py log
```

### Prevention

To avoid OTA issues in the future:

1. **Use auto-discovery** - `pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t ota_upload_auto` handles dynamic IPs automatically
2. **Use static IPs** - Set up DHCP reservations for consistent addressing
3. **Keep configs consistent** - Use same WiFi credentials across devices
4. **Test regularly** - Run discovery script periodically to check status
5. **Document IPs** - Keep track of ESP32 IP addresses
6. **Use environment variables** - Set DEATH_FORTUNE_HOST for convenience

## Troubleshooting Tips (Legacy)
- If OTA reports `Host ... Not Found`, ensure the ESP32 is on Wi-Fi and reachable (ping or `python scripts/telnet_command.py status`).
- Telnet tasks exiting with retry warnings indicate the board is offline; reset or reconnect Wi-Fi, then rerun.
- Serial fallback: use `python - <<'PY' ...` snippets (`/ai-work/ota-logging.md`) to grab 115200‚ÄØbaud logs when OTA/Telnet is unavailable.
