## Notes
- Story IDs map to future files in `/docs/stories/`; create each file as work begins.
- Update priorities and statuses as planning evolves and milestones complete.
- Consider splitting stories if scope expands beyond a single deliverable.
- Story 007 is a "maybe" story for potential framework migration from Arduino to ESP-IDF.
